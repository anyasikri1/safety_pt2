This non-interventional study case concerned an 86-year-old
male from Italy who developed sepsis, after an unspecified
duration of starting treatment with pralsetinib for non-small cell
lung cancer. The patient’s medical history, concurrent conditions,
concomitant medications and past drugs were not reported. An
unspecified duration after starting treatment with pralsetinib, the
patient developed bone marrow toxicity, hepatotoxicity,
hypertension, severe sepsis and bowel obstruction.
Subsequently the patient died due to sepsis, likely originating
from a urinary source and bowel obstruction. It was not reported
if an autopsy was performed. The physician assessed the
causality of severe sepsis as not related to pralsetinib."
