3 acute encephalopathy and Grade 2 urinary tract infection. The
patient’s laboratory results revealed negative results for bacterial
or viral etiology in the lumbar puncture, a negative herpes
simplex virus test, and negative blood and CSF cultures. A urine
culture showed a presence of Enterococcus faecalis. The patient
was started on cefepime for sepsis, aciclovir as empiric therapy
and haloperidol and olanzapine for agitation prophylaxis. On
Study Day 11, a CT of the head showed mild cerebral atrophy
along with small hyperintensity and small left calcified
meningioma. The following day, vancomycin was added to the
patient's sepsis treatment. An EEG showed signs of diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, possibly indicating toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy or medication effects. On Study Day 14, the
patient was started on ampicillin for sepsis. The patient’s blood
tests revealed mostly normal values with slightly low blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, and protein levels along with
slightly elevated glucose levels. On Study Day 19, heparin was
administered for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. On Study
Day 20, a rapid response team was called due to breathing
difficulties and non-responsiveness. The patient was found to
have hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and likely aspiration.
Given the patient's advanced illness and rapid decline, it was
decided to focus on comfort end-of-life care. The patient was
transferred to hospice care, with additional medications provided
for symptom management including ipratropium bromide,
salbutamol, glycopyrrolate, lorazepam and morphine. The
patient was unresponsive except for pain withdrawal and had
cool extremities. On Study Day 22, the patient experienced
significant seizures and high-grade fevers, initiating the

administration of ketorolac. On the same day, the patient died
due to sepsis. An autopsy was not performed. The physician
assessed the causality of sepsis and urinary tract infection as
not related to pralsetinib."


Though the event occured 10 days after therapy initiation with
pralsetinib, the overall status of the patient was declining with
toxic metabolic encephalopathy and metastasis to multiple sites..
Urine culture showed presence of Enterococcus faecalis which is
an opportunistic pathogen denoting the immunosuppressive
state of the patient. These  factors must have led to the

AER 3403972 (PT: Pneumonia): This non-interventional study
case concerns a male patient who developed pneumonia, 418
days after initiating therapy with pralsetinib for malignant lung
neoplasm. No medical history, past drugs, concurrent conditions
and concomitant medications were reported. After 378 days of
initiating therapy with pralsetinib, the patient developed
metastates to bone. After 418 days of therapy onset, the patient
developed lung infection, which was suspected due to white
blood cell low after chemotherapy, and died on the same day. It
was unknown if an autopsy was performed or not.
The underlying disease progression as evidenced by the bone
metastasis must have contributed to the occurence of the event.
Additionally, the white blood cells count was also low denoting
the patient's immunosuppressed state.

included asthenia, deafness, cough, blurred vision,
hypothyroidism and oral thrush. Concomitant medications
included dexamethasone, nystatin and tinzaparin. The patient's
baseline laboratory tests showed all blood cell counts and
percentages were within normal ranges, except for a slightly
elevated neutrophil percentage. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient
received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg (frequency
unspecified) and received till Study Day 26. On Study Day 26,
the pralsetinib dose was interrupted due to events of dizziness
and inability to walk. On Study Day 28, the patient was
diagnosed with Grade 4 pulmonary thromboembolism through
CT angiography and was hospitalized. Upon admission, the
patient presented with symptoms of hypoxemia, head blunting,
tachypnea, dyspnea and dizziness. Upon admission, the
patient's laboratory tests revealed normal blood cell counts and
differentials, with all measured parameters falling within typical
ranges. The thoracic CT angiogram revealed centered
mediastinal structures without pathologically sized lymph nodes.
The scan identified filling defects compatible with pulmonary
embolism, affecting both the right and left sides of the pulmonary
arterial system with laminar morphology, which could suggest
chronic thrombus. The pulmonary parenchyma appeared
heterogeneous with a mosaic pattern and multiple laminar
atelectasis, but no clear evidence of pulmonary infarction. An
infiltrative tumor lesion was also observed in the peritracheal and
peribronchial regions. On Study Day 32, the patient developed
Grade 5 cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia during
hospitalization which was confirmed by a microbiology study
conducted with a blood sample revealing CMV infection. It was
reported that the patient received steroids which could
predispose to this opportunistic CMV pneumonia infection. The
patient was started on ganciclovir. Laboratory tests conducted
on the same day showed slightly low hemoglobin, hematocrit,
and erythrocyte counts, which further decreased by Study Day

36. A follow-up thoracic CT angiogram on Study Day 37 showed
resolution of the previously observed pulmonary embolism
related filling defects. However, the appearance of patchy areas
of increased density with a ground-glass pattern in both lung
fields, suggesting either an inflammatory/infectious process or
drug toxicity. The scan also revealed progression of the
infiltrative tumor lesion and the appearance of bilateral pleural
effusion. The patient received tinzaparin as treatment for the
pulmonary thromboembolism. On Study Day 39, the patient died
due to respiratory insufficiency resulting from CMV pneumonia.
No autopsy was performed. The investigator reported that the
event of CMV pneumonia was not related to pralsetinib."


The patient had an underlying disease progression and chronic
pulmonary embolism which could have predisposed to infection.
There was also co-existing lymphopenia, oral thrush, concurrent
usage of dexamethasne and the presence of cytomegalovirus
which confirms the event to be attributed to the comromised
immune status of the patient.

simvastatin and apixaban. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient
received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg daily which
was temporarily interrupted on Study Day 115. On Study Day
136, pralsetinib was restarted at the same dose level and
interrupted again on Study Day 306. On Study Day 302, a CT
scan showed an enlarged low-attenuation structure surrounding
the left humeral head and proximal humerus and suspecting
hemorrhage. Subsequently, a chest CT showed a new small left
and right pleural effusion. On Study Day 304, laboratory tests
indicated anemia (Grade 3) and the patient reported intermittent
left upper extremity edema. The patient received a blood
transfusion on Study Day 305, which raised the hemoglobin
level. The following day, the patient developed a high fever of
104.2°F. On Study Day 307, the patient was hospitalized with
Grade 4 neutropenic sepsis, presenting with altered mentation,
fever, left shoulder pain, and arm swelling. Additional symptoms
included a reducible umbilical hernia and possible left lower lobe
pneumonia. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were
elevated, and laboratory tests revealed various abnormalities,
including low sodium, elevated BUN and creatinine, and
abnormal liver function tests. Blood and urine cultures were
positive for Staphylococcus aureus, leading to antibiotic
treatment with cefepime and vancomycin. The chest X-ray
findings revealed small opacities in the left basilar region of the
lung, possible indicating atelectasis, with or without concomitant
airspace disease along with a small amount of fluid in the left
pleural space, suggesting pneumonia. An ultrasound revealed
the presence of deep vein thrombosis. Further examinations on
Study Drug 308 and 309 revealed severely reduced systolic
function with global hypokinesia and septic arthritis. The patient

continued treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefazolin.
On Study Day 311, the patient experienced altered mental state
with dysarthria along with stroke resulting from chronic atrial
fibrillation (Grade 3). During hospitalization, the patient
developed acute renal failure. An MRI of the brain revealed
multiple small strokes secondary to atrial fibrillation and acute
ischemia infarction. Initially, anticoagulation was withheld due to
thrombocytopenia, however, apixaban was later administered
once the thrombocytopenia improved. By Study Day 313, the
patient's creatinine levels peaked, indicating Grade 1 acute
kidney injury. On Study Day 320, the patient experienced acute
respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia (Grade 5)
and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (Grade 4). A chest x-ray
showed airspace disease in bilateral lung bases, with layering
considering aspiration pneumonia. The patient died on the same
day due to acute respiration failure secondary to inspiration
pneumonia, complicated with a possible upper GI bleeding, atrial
fibrillation resulting in stroke and complicated with methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. No autopsy was
performed. The physician assessed the events aspiration
pneumonia and neutropenic sepsis as not related to pralsetinib. "


There was multiple co-morbidities present in the patient like
cerebro vascular accident, deep vein thrombosis dyslipidemia,
multiple neoplasms including secondary metastasis.  He was
also concomitantly taking prednisolone thus decreasing the
immunity of the patient. Patient also had  co-existing
pancytopenia depicting his immunosuppressed state.

sulfate and potassium chloride.

On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received study drug pralsetinib at
a dose of 400 mg (frequency unspecified). On Study Day 533, a
chest X-ray revealed a new cavitary lung lesion, possibly due to
aspiration after intubation for microdiscectomy. The patient was
hospitalized on Study Day 537 for L3/L4 microdiscectomy
followed by tissue plasminogen activator treatment. A pleural
drain was placed and the patient’s vital signs and laboratory
results were noted, including elevated blood pressure,
respiratory rate and blood markers. On Study Day 589, the
patient developed first episode of Grade 4 meningitis, presenting
with altered mental status, fever, lethargic, tachycardic and
tachypneic, leading to a sepsis alert due to empyema,
hydropneumothorax and abnormal urine with a suspected
pulmonary source. An epidural abscess was identified at L3-L4
and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Despite
various complications, including delirium, a trapped lung and a
distended bladder, initial CT scans showed no acute
abnormalities. The patient’s urinalysis was positive for protein,

CT scan of chest and pelvis showed moderate right-sided
hydropneumothorax. The patient received balsam peru-castor
oil, bimatoprost, brimonidine/timolol, calcium gluconate,
gentamicin, heparin, miconazole nitrate, mirtazapine, and
valacyclovir for the treatment of meningitis. Pralsetinib treatment
was suspended on the same day. On Study Day 590, the patient
was obtunded, tachypneic with coarse bilateral upper breath
sounds and diminished lung fields bilaterally. Imaging revealed a
significant fluid collection at the surgical site, and the patient was
placed on a positive pressure ventilator. On Study Day 591, the
patient experienced elevated C-reactive protein and a positive
enterococcus culture, with MRI showing a post-operative fluid
collection. Clinical examination was consistent with meningitis,
raising concerns about an iatrogenic cerebrospinal fluid leak
secondary to infection. The patient was hospitalized on the next
day with fever and underwent various procedures, including IR-
guided aspiration and antibiotic treatments with vancomycin,
ampicillin and ceftriaxone for iatrogenic meningitis. On Study
Day 593, the patient underwent surgical interventions for wound
repair and lumbar drain placement. The patient developed
encephalopathy secondary to meningitis along with cavitary lung
lesion and right empyema. On Study Day 601, the patient
experienced oropharyngeal dysphagia requiring tube feeding
and the patient received heparin for deep vein thrombosis
prophylaxis. On Study Day 615, the patient was discharged after
her prolonged hospitalization. On Study Day 617, the patient
developed second episode of meningitis (Grade 5) along with
lower abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, emesis and an
acute confusion. The patient’s vital signs were normal and
laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of potassium, BUN,
creatinine, AST, lipase, and lactate, along with an increased
anion gap and white blood cell count. Imaging studies revealed
cholelithiasis and pleural effusion and the patient received

patient was hospitalized. A CT scan revealed bilateral breast
cavity effusion, a significantly reduced right lung volume with an
ill-defined hilar mass and intermediate bronchial truncation, right
lung middle lobe atelectasis, suggesting potential malignant
neoplastic lesions. New multiple plaques were observed in both
lungs, indicating possible inflammation. The scan also showed
aortic and coronary atherosclerotic changes, as well as left renal
and hepatic cysts, potential intrahepatic bile duct calculi or
calcification foci, and subcapsular liver calcification foci.
Additionally, an abnormal bone density was observed in multiple
vertebrae and bilateral ribs suggesting possible metastasis.
Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were noted and a non-
invasive respiratory assistance was initiated along with a
comprehensive treatment regimen including antibiotics,
antispasmodics, antiasthmatics, antiarrhythmics, anti-shock and
symptomatic treatment. On Study Day 753, the patient’s
dyspnea worsened along with blurred consciousness requiring
endotracheal intubation. The following day, the patient was
declared clinically dead after continuous chest compressions
and intermittent intravenous injection of epinephrine. The patient
died due to pneumonia and circulatory failure. An autopsy was
not performed. The investigator assessed the pneumonia as not
related to pralsetinib."


The patient developed pneumonia after 2 years of initiation with
pralsetinib. Additionally, there is underlying disease progression
as evidenced by multiple vertebral metastasis. The concurrent
condition of cerebral ischemia could also predispose to
infections.

This clinical study case concerns a 70-year-old male patient who
developed pneumonia, 747 days after initiating therapy with
pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer. Concomitant
medications included levothyroxine, amlodipine and no medical
history, past drugs, concurrent conditions were reported. After
747 days of initiating therapy with pralsetinib, patient was
diagnosed with pneumonia (grade 2) and was hospitalized. The
CT chest was performed which showed increased multi local
ground glass opacities in both lungs (esp BLL) which was
pneumonia probably. There was no change of small
consolidative lesion inside the LUL bulla, emphysema, reticular
opacities, bronchiectasis in both lungs and no significant
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A day later, this episode of
pneumonia was resolved. After 1072 days of the initial therapy
with pralsetinib, the patient developed second episode of fatal
pneumonia. It was not reported whether autopsy was performed
or not.


The event of pneumonia developed more than 2 years after
initiation of treatment with pralsetinib, which is an unduly long
latency for a causative infection to appear. Secondly, the patient
had an underlying advanced malignancy, which in addition to the
elderly age could have contributed to the immunosuppression
predisposing the patient to pneumonia.

No past drugs and concurrent conditions were reported.

After 1015 days of initiating therapy with pralsetinib, the patient
developed non-infectious pneumonia, CTCAE grade 1, due to
which study drug was interrupted. Approximately 13 days later,
the patient returned to the site and the investigator found that
non-infectious pneumonia had improved, and the study drug was
resumed.

After 1095 days of initiating therapy with pralsetinib, the patient
developed cough and fever reaching to 38 degrees Celsius and
tested positive for COVID antigen nucleic acid test. The event
progressed from grade2 to grade 4 and most extreme severity:
grade 5 and the drug was temporarily interrupted. Two days after
the diagnosis, the patient’s CT (Computed tomography) scan
showed pneumonia. The patient felt no discomfort and cough
stopped and the patient resumed the study drug dose of 200 mg.
As the COVID-19 became serious, the patient was hospitalized,
and the study drug was again interrupted. On day 16 of
diagnosis, novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection showed
masculine. On day 19, the patient was transferred to the
department the intensive care medicine for continued treatment
and on the next day, the patient was transferred to ICU with

showed pneumonia. On day 28 of the event onset, the patient
was declared dead. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed
or not. "


The event of pneumonia developed 3 years after initiation of
treatment with pralsetinib, which is an unduly long latency for a
causative infection to appear. Moreover the infection was
reported as non-infectious to begin with and the patient tested
positive for COVID-19 which explains the event. Moreover, the
concurrent condition of diabetes could have added to the
severity and to a fatal outcome.

included acute appendicitis GR4, concurrent conditions included
hypertension grade 2, hyperlipidemia grade 2, peripheral
sensory neuropathy grade 2, constipation grade 2, alopecia

pantoprazole, benzydamine, gluconate sodium;magnesium
chloride;potassium chloride;sodium acetate;sodium chloride
(Plasma Solution A). The patient had no history of tobacco use
and no past drugs were reported. After 23 days of initiating
therapy with pralsetinib, the patient was diagnosed with
pneumonia on chest CT (initial and most extreme NCI-CTCAE
grade: 5). On the same day the AE became serious, and subject
was hospitalized at nearby hospital. On day 24 of the diagnosis,
the patient died of aggravated pneumonia. The relevant medical
records and other details (autopsy) were refused to be provided
by the family.


The patient developed pneumonia 23 days into therapy with
pralsetinib which has a compatible temporal plausibility. the
aggravation of this condition can be explained by his underlying
metastatic cancer and concomitant steroid therapy. The
circumstances leading to death are not very clear as autopsy
details were unavailable. However, pulmonary embolism is a
possible risk factor.

acute infarcts involving the left cerebellum, bilateral
temporooccipital regions, and left centrum semiovale. The dose
of pralsetinib was interrupted in response to the intracerebral
hemorrhage. On the same day, laboratory results showed a
white blood cell count of 5600/μL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and
