Subsequently, progressive worsening with cough and dyspnea.
The patient developed g3 lung infection not related to the
treatment/disease (covid 19). Ten days after the diagnosis, the
patient was hospitalized. The PCR was positive for COVID-19
and the chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with
pneumonia. The patient required oxygen with facemask to

treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, norepinephrine, and
oxygen (3 L/min). After 21 days of therapy initiation, cefepime (2
g every 8 hours) was added to the treatment regimen. After 23
days of starting therapy with the study drug, chest radiography
revealed an infectious focus on the left side. After 25 days of
therapy initiation, the treatment was escalated to include
meropenem (6 g once daily), daptomycin, amikacin, and
midazolam (5 mg). After 26 days of initiating therapy with
pralsetinib the patient died due to septic shock. It was not
reported whether an autopsy was performed. The invetigator
assessed fatal septic shock as related to pralsetinib
