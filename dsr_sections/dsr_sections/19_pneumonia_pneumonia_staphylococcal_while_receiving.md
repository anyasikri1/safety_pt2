patient had an oncology history of papillary thyroid cancer, colon
polyp and thyroid cancer along with cancer treatment regimens
and prior cancer surgeries. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient
received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 300 mg (frequency
unspecified) and received till Study Day 20. On Study Day 20,
the patient experienced the first episode COVID-19 pneumonia
(Grade 3) with symptoms including sore throat, headache,
cough, fever, and mild diarrhea and was hospitalized. Laboratory
tests confirmed COVID-19 infection and revealed various
abnormalities, including low sodium levels and elevated liver
enzymes. A chest x-ray showed mild bilateral infiltrates with
small effusions. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids
and paracetamol. On Study Day 21, further tests revealed
elevated C-reactive protein, low hemoglobin, and persistently
low sodium levels. Treatment with pralsetinib was interrupted on
the same day. On Study Day 30, the patient was recovering from
COVID-19 pneumonia and was discharged. Pralsetinib was
restarted at 300 mg on Study Day 31. On Study Day 35, the
patient experienced a second episode of COVID-19 pneumonia
(Grade 3), leading to hospital re-admission. Despite a negative
PCR test, chest CT showed bilateral COVID-type infiltrates.
Laboratory results indicated various abnormalities, including
elevated liver enzymes and inflammatory markers. During this
hospitalization, the patient received additional treatments,
including empiric bacterial treatment with levofloxacin and
respiratory therapies. Pralsetinib was interrupted again on Study
Day 36. On Study Day 39, the patient was discharged and the
second episode of COVID-19 pneumonia resolved. Pralsetinib
was restarted at 300 mg on Study Day 40, however by Study
Day 43, the patient experienced a third episode of COVID-19
pneumonia (Grade 3) and laboratory results showed various
abnormalities, including liver enzyme elevations and coagulation
irregularities. Pralsetinib was discontinued again on the same

day. On Study Day 45, the patient was hospitalized again due to
chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. On Study Day 46, laboratory
results revealed low hemoglobin levels, low Lymphocyte counts
and elevated inflammatory markers, electrolyte imbalances,
particularly hyponatremia. On the same day, the third episode
COVID-19 pneumonia resolved. On Study Day 47, the patient
was diagnosed with Grade 3 pneumonia staphylococcal and
eventually the patient developed Grade 5 sepsis. Intravenous
vancomycin treatment was initiated, but sepsis persisted.
Sputum culture results revealed a significant presence of
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). On Study
Day 50, the patient died due to sepsis. No autopsy was
performed. The physician assessed the episodes of COVID-19
pneumonia, pneumonia MRSA, and sepsis as not related to
pralsetinib.
The patient had multiple co-morbidities like highly advanced
malignancies including secondories, multiple past surgeries,
paraplegic state and radiotherapy which could explain the

pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg (frequency unspecified) and
received till Study Day 576. The patient’s neutrophil and platelet
counts were within normal range on Study Day 576.
Subsequently, the patient experienced hematochezia following
which the patient's hemoglobin levels and platelet counts
decreased. The patient received piperacillin/tazobactam for
infection prophylaxis along with packed red blood cell. The
patient’s COVID-19 PCR test was negative. A high-resolution CT
scan of chest revealed a newly developed ground-glass
opacities at both lungs, suggesting possible atypical pneumonia
along with small amounts of bilateral pleural effusion,
subsegmental atelectasis at both lower lobe and slightly
increased tumor burden. Subsequently, on Study Day 577, the
patient developed Grade 5 pneumonia. The hemoglobin level
was maintained at 10.9 g/dL (reference range 13.0-17.4 g/dL).
Antibiotics administered to treat pneumonia included
meropenem, levofloxacin, teicoplanin, and
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim along with high oxygen
treatment. The patient exhibited low partial pressure of oxygen
(PO2) and oxygen saturation, accompanied by elevated C-
reactive protein (CRP) levels and low white blood cell count. No
causative pathogen of pneumonia was identified. Over the
course of treatment from Study Day 578 to 579, the patient's
condition fluctuated, with some improvements in oxygen levels
and white blood cell count, but persistent low hemoglobin levels
and platelet counts. Lung radiographs showed deterioration, and
the patient’s oxygen demand increased and oxygen saturation
continued to decrease despite maintenance of hyperbaric
oxygen therapy. The patient received various treatments,
including albumin, vitamins, and respiratory medications. On

Study Day 579, moxifloxacin was administered for pneumonia,
however the patient’s blood tests indicated that oxygenation
levels and cell count remained below normal ranges. On the
same day, the patient died due to pneumonia. An autopsy was
not performed. Therapy with pralsetinib was discontinued in
response to pneumonia. The physician assessed pneumonia as
not related to pralsetinib.
The patient was diabetic and of advanced age with progression
of underlying malignancy. He also had prior radiotherapy and co-
existing cytopenia which predisposed the patient to infections

This clinical study case concerned an 84-year-old female
(patient number: 6317004) from China who developed aspiration
pneumonia, 3 days after starting therapy with pralsetinib for
poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The patient’s concurrent
conditions included thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, diabetes,
chronic gastritis, room premature beats, anemia and complete
right bundle branch block. Concomitant medications included
levothyroxine and sodium. No medical history and past drugs
were reported. The patient had no history of cancer treatment.
On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received study drug pralsetinib at
a dose of 400 mg daily and received till Study Day 3. On Study
Day 3, after receiving the most recent dose, the patient
developed Grade 3 aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented
to the emergency room with choking on eating and a fever of
39°C. The baseline CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass on the
left side of trachea. During the initial physical examination, a
neck mass was also observed. It was reported that the
compression of the esophagus by the tumor was causing the
patient to choke while eating which eventually led to pneumonia
aspiration. The patient was treated with anti-infective
medications and nutritional support treatment during
hospitalization. On Study Day 4, the patient was unable to take

pralsetinib due pneumonia aspiration and therefore, therapy with
pralsetinib was suspended. On Study Day 12, the pneumonia
aspiration worsened to grade 5 and the patient died in the
hospital due to pneumonia aspiration. The autopsy was not
performed. The physician assessed the aspiration pneumonia as
not related to pralsetinib.
The event occurred due to aspiration of food due to the choking
effect of the underlying malignancy. There was also no lab
investigations reported to prove an infective etiology.

received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 300 mg daily. On
Study Day 753, the patient experienced worsened difficulty
breathing with associated wheezing, and the patient was on 3 L
of continuous oxygen at home. From Study Day 754 to 755, the
oxygen requirement was increased to 5 L. On Study Day 756,
the patient developed Grade 4 pneumonia aspiration and
anemia with oxygen needs rising to 8L. The patient's condition
rapidly deteriorated, leading to an emergency response. Initially
conscious but cyanotic upon EMS arrival, the patient became
unresponsive and pulseless. After extensive resuscitation efforts,
including six rounds of CPR and epinephrine administration,
spontaneous circulation was restored. At the emergency
department, the patient was intubated but remained
unresponsive, later developing hypotension and bradycardia with
minimal neurological responses. On Study Day 757, the patient
had second occurrence of pneumonia aspiration (Grade 5).
Comprehensive laboratory tests revealed multiple abnormalities,
including elevated lactate, acidosis, hypoxemia, anemia,
electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia, elevated liver enzymes,
positive urine bacteria, blood culture showing Actinomyces
naeslundii and elevated cardiac markers, though without signs of
myocardial infarction. Imaging studies showed no pulmonary
embolism but did show mild ground-glass opacities in both lungs
with dependent atelectasis, potentially indicative of pulmonary
edema or atypical pneumonia, along with rib fractures likely from
CPR. Sputum culture indicated normal upper respiratory flora,
while the gram stain of the lower respiratory culture showed a
significant presence of gram-positive cocci. Treatment
medications included epinephrine, norepinephrine, iohexol,
fentanyl, midazolam, piperacillin/tazobactam, acetaminophen,
