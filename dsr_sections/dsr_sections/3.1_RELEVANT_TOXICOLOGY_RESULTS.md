RELEVANT TOXICOLOGY RESULTS
The toxicology program for pralsetinib to date consists of oral single- and repeat-dose
toxicity studies with durations up to 13 weeks in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, in vitro
and in vivo genotoxicity, embryo-fetal developmental toxicity, fertility and early
embryonic development toxicity, in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity studies, in vitro safety
pharmacology studies and a single dose cardiovascular safety study in rats. The main
toxicities of pralsetinib observed in rat and/or monkeys included hematological
abnormalities, effects on bony tissues, reproductive/developmental toxicities, metabolic
perturbation, and effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. With the
exception of developmental toxicities, which were attributed to on-target RET inhibition,
the majority of the pralsetinib-related toxicologic effects were attributed to off-target
