3.2.2
ARROW Study
In this non-comparative trial, as of 04 March 2022, 590 patients have received at least
one dose of pralsetinib (regardless of dose and indication). Of these patients, 299 were
treated for metastatic RET-fusion NSCLC. An overview of key safety results for this
population is provided in Table 11 and are summarized below:
Overall, 588/590 patients (99.7%) in this population experienced an AE. A total of
485/590 patients (82.2%) experienced a Grade 3 AE.
A total of 376/590 patients (63.7%) experienced a SAE of which infection related SAEs
were reported as Pneumonia in 77/590 (13.1%) patients, Sepsis in 24/590 (4.1%)
patients, Urinary tract infection in 23/590 (3.9%) patients and Coronavirus infection in
20/590 (3.4%) patients.
Further, a total of 335/590 patients (56.8%) experienced a Grade 3 SAE. Of these
Grade 3 SAEs of infections were reported in 125/590 patients (21.2%); Grade 4 AEs
were reported in 19/590 patients (3.2%) and fatal AEs (Grade 5 AEs) were reported in
24/590 patients (4.1%) (see Table 11).

The most frequently PTs of infections (Grade 3-4) observed were: Pneumonia
(9.3%), Sepsis (3.2%), Urinary tract infection (3.6%), Coronavirus infection (2.5%)
and Diverticulitis (1.0%). All the remaining PTs reported frequency of 1%.

The most frequently PT with Grade 5 severity was Pneumonia (1.9%).

Further, treatment-related Grade 5 AEs included pneumonia (3 patients) and
pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (1 patient).

Opportunistic infections reported in the study included pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia (n=6), Herpes zoster (n=3), Pneumonia legionella (n=2),
Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (n=1), Pneumonia cytomegaloviral (n=1), Sinusitis
aspergillus (n=1), Proteus infection (n=1), Oropharyngeal candidiasis (n=1),
Klebsiella bacteraemia (n=1) and Atypical mycobacterial pneumonia (n=1). Majority
of these infections were Grade 3 while pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and
Pneumonia cytomegaloviral (n=1 each) were Grade 5.
Table 11 presents an overview of the infection SAEs (with 1% frequency) by MedDRA
PT and severity Grades. The remaining infection SAEs reported a frequency 1% and
are presented in Appendix 3.
