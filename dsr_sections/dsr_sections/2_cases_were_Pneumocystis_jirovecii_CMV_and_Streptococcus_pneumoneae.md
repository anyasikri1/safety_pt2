2 cases were Pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV and Streptococcus pneumoneae.
Category B cases:
Of the total, 301 cases reporting 349 infection events (43 Grade 5, 40 Grade 4 and 267
Grade 3) reported additional risk factors which could have contributed to the reported
infection. The most common PTs reported were Pneumonia (n=95) followed by Urinary
tract infection (n=37) Sepsis (n=34) COVID 19 (n=14) and COVID 19 pneumonia (n=13).

Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
The risk factors and/or alternate explanations included pre-existing co-morbidities such
as diabetes, lymphopenia, dyslipidemia, pre-existing infections, underlying cancer
progression with multiple metastatic sites, chronic renal insufficiency, co-existing
fractures and/or use of anticancer drugs like cisplatin, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, use of
immunosuppressant drugs such as tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, prednisolone,
dexamethasone, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and invasive medical procedures.
Evidence of cytopenias including lymphopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia was
identified in 82/301 cases.
Category C cases:
The remaining 84 cases had insufficient information regarding underlying medical
conditions, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications, drug-event latency,
diagnostic details and/or event course details for a comprehensive causality analysis for
the events and pralsetinib.
For the remaining 249/740 cases reporting 272 AEs, information on severity grading was
lacking. The most commonly reported PT was of Pneumonia and none of these cases
were assessed as category A. Twenty-six cases were assessed as Category B with risk
factors/alternative explanations (e.g., underlying cancer progression and use of
immunosuppressive medications). The remaining 223 cases were assessed as Category
C with insufficient information regarding underlying medical conditions, concurrent
diseases, concomitant medications and/or event course details to enable an adequate
causality analysis for the events and pralsetinib.
