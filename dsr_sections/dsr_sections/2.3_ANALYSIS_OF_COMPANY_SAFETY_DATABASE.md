is considered “suspect”.

Reports from unsolicited sources: including all serious and non-serious cases
arising from spontaneous reports, scientific literature, Internet and digital media and
other sources (e.g., newspapers and lay media).

Reports from solicited sources other than interventional clinical trials: including all
serious and non-serious cases arising from organized data collections systems,
including non-interventional studies, market research, and patient support programs.
