3.2.1
AcceleRET-Lung Study
In the clinical trial AcceleRET-Lung, as of 12 July 2024, 108 subjects received pralsetinib
and 104 subjects received standard of care/ comparator treatment. A total of 14 subjects
(14/108; 13.0%) in the pralsetinib treatment arm and 5 subjects (5/104; 4.8%) in
comparator arm developed fatal AEs (see Table 3).
Of note, fatal infections are a subset of fatal AEs, i.e., out of the total fatal AEs, 5 fatal
events were due to infections occurred in the pralsetinib arm while no fatal infection was
observed in the Standard of Care arm. However, for comparative safety between the
arms, Table 4 presents the breakdown of all fatal events including fatal infections by
broad medical concept.
