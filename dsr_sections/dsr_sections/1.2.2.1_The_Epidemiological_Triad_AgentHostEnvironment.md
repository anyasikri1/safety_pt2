1.2.2.1
The Epidemiological Triad: Agent–Host–Environment
The epidemiological triad, a foundational model in understanding infectious disease
causation suggests that such illnesses emerge from the interplay of three key elements:
the pathogenic agent, the host, and environmental factors. This triad encompasses a
diverse array of infectious agents, ranging from living parasites like helminths and
protozoa to fungi and bacteria, as well as non-living entities such as viruses and prions.

Environmental conditions play a crucial role in determining whether a potential host
encounters these pathogens, while the subsequent interactions between the agent and
the host ultimately dictate the outcome of the exposure. This model thus provides a
comprehensive framework for comprehending the multifaceted nature of infectious
disease development and transmission (Van Seventer and Hochberg, 2017).
1.2.2.2
Factors Responsible for Increased Susceptibility to Severe
Infections in Solid Tumor Patients
Cancer patients have an increased susceptibility to infections due to several factors. An
overview of the main factors responsible are:
Neutropenia
Neutropenia remains the most common predisposing factor for infection in cancer
patients and both the degree and the duration of neutropenia influence the development
of infection. The currently accepted definition of neutropenia is an absolute neutrophil
count of 500/mm3. Most serious infections, including bacteremia, develop during
episodes of severe and prolonged neutropenia, and virtually every patient whose
neutrophil count is less than 100/mL for 3 weeks or more will develop an infection,
indicating a direct relationship between the risk of infection and the duration of
neutropenia. Neutropenic patients often fail to develop the characteristic signs and
symptoms of infection, since they are unable to mount an adequate inflammatory
response and infection can disseminate widely. The most common sites of infection in
neutropenic patients include the lung, oropharynx, blood, urinary tract, skin, and soft
tissues, including the perirectal area. Infections are generally caused by organisms
already colonizing the patient.
Immune Dysfunction
The impact of cancer on the peripheral immune system is multifaceted, involving
changes in hematopoiesis, alterations in cellular populations, and functional impairments
across various immune lineages. The malignant state shifts bone marrow hematopoiesis
towards increased production of immature neutrophils and monocytes. This occurs
through an elevated frequency of hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte monocyte
progenitors. In some cases, this shift comes at the expense of dendritic cell precursors,
which share common progenitors. The result is a systemic reduction in dendritic cells,
driven by two main mechanisms. First, granulocyte colony stimulating factor stimulate
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 signaling while suppressing interferon
regulatory factor-8. Second, vascular endothelial growth factor decreases nuclear factor-
kappa B signaling. The bone marrow also experiences a decrease in T cell, B cell, and
plasma cell populations. This reduction in lymphoid lineages further contributes to the
overall immune dysregulation observed in cancer patients. Beyond quantitative changes,
cancer also induces qualitative alterations in immune cell function. Notably, T cell
populations and natural killer cells exhibit functional deficits in their response to stimuli.

This impaired responsiveness can significantly compromise the immune system's ability
to mount effective anti-tumor responses (Somasundaram et al. 2022).
Medications
Chemotherapeutic agents contribute to increased infection susceptibility through multiple
pathways. One primary mechanism is the induction of severe mucositis, particularly in
the gastrointestinal tract, which compromises the body's natural barriers. This damage
facilitates the entry of microorganisms into tissues and the bloodstream. Additionally,
myelosuppressive agents cause neutropenia, a well-documented risk factor for
infections. Many chemotherapeutic drugs interfere with cell-mediated and humoral
immunity, even when administered at doses that do not typically result in significant
myelosuppression. Agents such as azathioprine, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil,
cyclophosphamide, and systemic corticosteroids fall into this category, elevating
infection risk through their immunosuppressive effects. A range of other medications can
cause milder impairment of immune function, particularly when used in combination with
other agents. Methotrexate is one such example. Biological agents also play a role in
modulating immune responses, potentially increasing infection susceptibility. These
include tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists like infliximab, etanercept, and
adalimumab, as well as various interleukin (IL) antibodies. The latter group
encompasses IL-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab), IL-17 antibodies (secukinumab,
ixekizumab, brodalumab), and IL-4 receptor antibodies (dupilumab). Furthermore,
immunoglobulin E antibodies such as omalizumab, JAK receptor inhibitors like
tofacitinib, and Phosphodiesterase E4 inhibitors such as apremilast can also contribute
to immune suppression. The cumulative effect of these various agents, whether used
alone or in combination, can significantly compromise the immune system's capacity to
combat infections (Somasundaram et al. 2022).
Medical Conditions and Lifestyle Factors
A range of medical conditions significantly elevate the risk of infections. These include
metabolic disorders such as diabetes, respiratory diseases like Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and various autoimmune disorders. Immunocompromised
states also play a crucial role, encompassing conditions such as cystic fibrosis, Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, and post-transplantation scenarios. Tobacco use, poor
nutritional status, chronic stress, and insufficient sleep all contribute to weakened
immune responses. Advanced age is another significant factor that can compromise the
body's ability to fight off infections. Cancer patients face additional, specific challenges
that contribute to their infection risk. The local effects of tumors, particularly metastases
causing obstructions and disruption to normal anatomical barriers, can create
environments conducive to infection. Moreover, the use of invasive devices (central
venous catheters, urinary catheters, feeding tubes), altered microbial flora (due to broad-
spectrum antibiotics), organ dysfunction, prolonged hospitalization and surgical
procedures often increase the risk of infections in cancer patients (Budisan et al. 2021).
