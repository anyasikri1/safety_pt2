1.2.1.2
Relevant Information in the core RMP
Pralsetinib has been observed to cause hematological effects in both preclinical and
clinical settings. These effects include reduced bone marrow cellularity, decreased
hemoglobin levels, lowered reticulocyte counts, diminished lymphoid cellularity, and
decreased lymphocyte counts. These changes, particularly prominent in the initial two
weeks of treatment, are consistent with off target Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) inhibition of
pralsetinib. This risk is further compounded by patients' potentially immunocompromised
state due to prior chemotherapy or their underlying malignancy. Clinical observations of
patients treated with pralsetinib have shown decreases in blood cell counts, specifically
anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia, a known side effect of
various tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, lenvatinib, and
cabozantinib, is of particular concern as it can place patients at an even greater risk of
developing severe infections (Gavreto cRMP).
