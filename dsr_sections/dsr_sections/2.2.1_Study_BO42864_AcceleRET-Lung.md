2.2.1
Study BO42864 (AcceleRET-Lung)
A randomized, open label, parallel, active controlled, Phase III study of pralsetinib versus
standard of care for first-line treatment of RET fusion-positive, metastatic NSCLC, is
currently ongoing; however, a decision has been made to stop the study based on the
decision taken by Blueprint Medicines to terminate marketing and development of
Gavreto outside of the United States and Greater China, and following that decision, the
study has been unblinded. The decision to terminate the study was not based on any
findings related to efficacy or safety of pralsetinib in the trial participants. The safety
population includes all patients who received any amount of study drug. Only adverse
events that occurred during the main treatment period are included in these analyses;
patients randomized to the control arm had the option to receive pralsetinib following
disease progression. Please see Figure 1 for study design.

The AcceleRET-Lung study presents the first opportunity to consider randomized safety
data comparing pralsetinib with standard of care treatment options (platinum
doublet pembrolizumab) in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC. The data used
for DSR authoring was based on data extracted from the study’s clinical database on
12 July 2024. The last patient was enrolled on 6 February 2024, hence this data-cut
represents a relatively mature dataset for evaluating safety (212 safety evaluable
patients in this analysis, from a planned enrollment of 226 patients). Note; however, that
this dataset does not correspond to a formal data-cut for the study, so missing
information and inconsistencies in the data are to be expected. The study was unblinded
following the decision to terminate the study, allowing for a by treatment analysis of the
data. Adverse Events were coded using MedDRA version 27.0.
