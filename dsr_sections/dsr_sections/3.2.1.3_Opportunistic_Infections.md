3.2.1.3
Opportunistic Infections
The review of the data from AcceleRET-Lung for the presence of Grade 3-5
opportunistic infections was also performed. From the review, it has been identified that
a total of 8 AEs related to opportunistic infections were reported in 7 patients (7/108;
6.5%) in pralsetinib treatment arm, however no patients in the standard of care arm
presented with opportunistic infections (see Table 7).

PTs of the opportunistic infections reported in pralsetinib arm included
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (n=3); Pneumonia cytomegaloviral, (n=2);
Pneumonia legionella, Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Oesophageal
candidiasis (n=1 each).

All these AEs were of Grade 3-4 severity.

The time to onset observed for these AEs ranged from 26 to 280 days (with a
median of 116.5 days). All of these AEs were reported as resolved/ resolved with
sequelae.

Of the 7 patients who developed opportunistic infections, only 2/7 patients had been
taking systemic corticosteroids prior to the onset of the infection (see Table 8)

From this analysis, prior corticosteroid use does not appear to be an inciting risk
factor for the development of severe opportunistic infections in pralsetinib treated
patients in AcceleRET-Lung.
