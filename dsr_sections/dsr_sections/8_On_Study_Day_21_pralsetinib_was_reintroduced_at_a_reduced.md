patient experienced fever, cough, rhinorrhea and dizziness. The
following day, the patient developed Grade 4 pneumonia leading
to a temporary interruption of pralsetinib treatment. The patient
had mild dyspnea with clear consciousness and was sent to the
emergency department on the same day. A chest x-ray showed
increased right lower lobe infiltration along with elevated heart
rate, low oxygen saturation and rapid respiratory rate. The
patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, with severe desaturation,
necessitating intubation. A chest CT scan showed pneumonia at
right middle lobe along with infection and inflammatory changes
in both lungs and bilateral pulmonary emphysema leading to
hospitalization. Additional laboratory tests showed positive
results for influenza A + B rapid screening and elevated high
sensitivity C-reactive protein. Following admission, the patient
developed profound shock. Treatment included administration of
inotropes and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. Peripheral
cyanosis was observed, and due to refractory lactate acidosis,
continuous veno-venous hemofiltration was initiated. On Study
Day 835, it was reported that the pneumonia had resolved with
sequelae, and the patient was discharged. On the same day, the
patient died due to sepsis (Grade 5). Blood culture results
revealed the presence of Escherichia coli and multiple organ
failure was noted. No autopsy was performed. The investigator
assessed pneumonia and sepsis as not related to pralsetinib.

after initiating therapy with pralsetinib for an unknown indication.
No medical history, past drugs, concurrent conditions and

duration of starting treatment with pralsetinib, the patient
developed COVID-19. Therapy with pralsetinib was withdrawn in
response to the covid-19, due to economic reasons. On an
unknown date, the patient died due to Covid-19, being the
primary cause. However, the discontinuation of the drug due to
economic reason was considered as second cause of death. It
was unknown if an autopsy was performed or not.

This clinical study case concerned a 78-year-old male (patient
number: 6301010) from China who developed pneumonia, 48
days after starting therapy with pralsetinib for lung
adenocarcinoma. The patient’s medical history, concurrent
conditions and past drugs were not reported. Concomitant
medications included cefoperazone/sulbactam, budesonide,
terbutaline, acetylcysteine and ibuprofen.

On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received study drug pralsetinib at
a dose of 400 mg daily received till Study Day 42. The pralsetinib
dose was temporarily interrupted due to events of Grade 3
hyponatremia and Grade 3 hypophosphatemia. On Study Day
46, the patient was hospitalized for symptomatic treatment. The
following day, the patient experienced fever along with cough,
sputum, shortness of breath and fatigue. Treatment included
high-dose oxygen inhalation, ibuprofen and antibiotics. Blood
test on the same day revealed hypophosphatemia. Additional
laboratory tests showed low values of total protein and albumin,
slightly low sodium and potassium, and markedly low inorganic
phosphorus. Liver enzymes and renal function tests appeared

normal. Cardiac enzymes showed some elevation, particularly
lactic dehydrogenase and α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase. The
blood test revealed low hemoglobin and platelet count. Blood
cultures were negative for bacterial and fungal growth after 5
days. On Study Day 48, the patient developed Grade 4
pneumonia with hemoptysis. Treatment medications included
budesonide, terbutaline, acetylcysteine, imipenem/cilastatin and
hemocoagulase. Tests conducted on the same day revealed
elevated levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, while the
fungus D-glucose test was negative. A chest radiograph showed
right lung cancer and bilateral pneumonia. Despite ongoing
treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and the patient
insisted to be discharged. On Study Day 49, the patient was
discharged with a prescription for ambroxol. The patient died at
home on Study Day 50 and the cause of death was considered
as aggravated pneumonia. It was not reported if an autopsy was
performed. The physician assessed the causality of pneumonia
as not related to pralsetinib.

pneumonia, 353 days after starting therapy with pralsetinib for
non-small cell lung cancer. The patient’s medical history,
concurrent conditions and past drugs were not reported.
Concomitant medications included zoledronic acid and calcium
carbonate/colecalciferol

On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received study drug pralsetinib at
a dose of 400 mg daily and received till Study Day 353. Since
Study Day 344, the patient reported flu-like symptoms without
fever or breathing difficulties, however, by Study Day 352, the
patient’s general condition worsened with increased shortness of
breath. On Study Day 353, the patient developed Grade 5
COVID-19 pneumonia and was hospitalized. The following day,
the patient was transferred to intensive care unit and received
non-invasive ventilation through upper airway. The patient was
intubated and needed catecholamine therapy. Eventually, the
patient’s condition deteriorated and he developed a septic shock
and kidney failure. On Study Day 367, the patient became
cardiopulmonary unstable and died due to COVID-19
pneumonia. An autopsy was not performed. The physician
assessed the COVID-19 pneumonia as not related to pralsetinib.
