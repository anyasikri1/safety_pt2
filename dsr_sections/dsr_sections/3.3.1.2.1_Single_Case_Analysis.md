3.3.1.2.1
Single Case Analysis
All the 43 cases reporting life threatening infections were medically evaluated and
assigned to the causality categories based on the strategy described in Section 2.3.1.
Upon review of the cases reporting life threatening infections, two (2/43) cases were
assessed as having a likely causal association between the event and pralsetinib
treatment in the absence of alternative explanations (Category A), 36/43 cases were
identified with reported risk factors/alternative explanations for the event (Category B)

Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
and 5/43 were having insufficient information that could enable a comprehensive
causality assessment (Category C).
Category A: Of the total 43 cases, two (2/43; 4.6%) cases were assessed as providing a
likely association between pralsetinib and infections without contributory risk factors or
alternative explanations reported in the case details. A brief overview of these cases is
presented below:

Both the cases reported from clinical studies and were medically confirmed.

The PTs reported in these cases included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (n=1)
and Neutropenic sepsis (n=1).

The first dose latencies for the AEs were 65 and 1460 days.

Both the events resolved following pralsetinib therapy interruption and introduction
of corrective treatment which included levofloxacin, tazobactam/ piperacillin, steroid
pulse therapy, meropenem.

Positive rechallenge was not reported in any of these cases.

Evidence of neutropenia was found in one case reporting neutropenic sepsis.

The organisms identified in these 2 cases were Pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV and
Streptococcus pneumoneae.

The reporting investigator assessed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia as related
while neutropenic sepsis as not related to pralsetinib treatment.
The details of these cases are presented below:
AER 320764915 (PT: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia): This clinical study case
concerns a 74-year- old elderly male patient, (patient number: 8411001) who developed
pneumocystis pneumonia and cholangitis whilst participating in BO42864, a phase III,
randomized, open-label study of pralsetinib versus standard of care for first-line
treatment of RET fusion positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Concurrent conditions (baseline conditions and other concurrent adverse events with
onset prior to the occurrence of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) included arthralgia,
cataract, cough, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, sinus
tachycardia, blood creatinine increased (grade 1), alanine aminotransferase Increased
(grade 1), AST Increased (grade 1).
oncomitant medications included olmesartan medoxomil, probiotics, pirenoxine,
tiquizium bromide, ketoprofen, dequalinium chloride, paracetamol, sodium gualenate
hydrate, trichlormethiazide, bisoprolol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide hydrate and
nifedipine.

15 The case AER 3207649 (Patient number: 8411/001) has also been reported in clinical outputs.

Thirteen days into therapy with pralsetinib (400 mg, once daily) the patient developed
increased creatine phosphokinase, subsequent to which the therapy with pralsetinib was
withdrawn. Six days later pralsetinib was restarted with dose reduced to 300 mg, once
daily. Forty-six days later (Study day), the patient developed pneumocystis pneumonia
(grade 2) with fever and was hospitalized. Laboratory tests included a CT scan that
revealed shadows in both lungs that took the form of ground glass opacities; COVID-19
test was negative. C-reactive protein was elevated to 13, oxygen saturation was 98% in
the sitting position, 88% in the supine position and pneumocystis carinii PCR test was
positive. Treatment with levofloxacin, tazobactam and piperacillin infusion was started.
Beta d glucan test results were found to be elevated at 273.4 and treatment was
provided for suspected pneumocystis pneumonia. The patient's condition rapidly
deteriorated within 24 hours of admission. Initially, he was on 1L/min oxygen, but his
respiratory function had significantly worsened, necessitating an increase to 7L/min
oxygen, which still failed to adequately compensate. Based on blood tests and X-rays, it
was determined that the patient's pneumonia had progressed. The decline was
attributed to either a pneumocystis infection or drug-induced lung injury. The patient
required high-flow nasal cannula (NHF) at 50L/min with 80% oxygen. Blood gas analysis
revealed: pH: 7.484, PaO2: 70.2 mmHg, and PaCO2: 31.7 mmHg, prompting a switch to
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) at Grade 4. The patient was started on
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) with Positive End Expiratory Pressure 4
(PEEP) at FiO2 80%. As the patient tolerated the treatment, settings were adjusted to
PEEP6 at FiO2 70%. SpO2 was maintained at high 90s. Subsequent blood gas analysis
showed improvement: pH: 7.532, PO2: 169.8 mmHg, PCO2: 27.4 mmHg, Lactate: 0.87
mmol/L. Despite better oxygenation, the patient couldn't be weaned off NPPV.
Treatment continued with tazobactam, piperacillin, and steroid pulse therapy was
initiated. Three days later, the patient's respiratory status began to improve, allowing a
reduction in oxygen support to NHF 40L/min at 50% to 40% oxygen. Chest imaging
showed improvement in lung field shadows. However, new complications arose,
including nausea and liver dysfunction. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed
cholangitis, leading to the discontinuation of pralsetinib treatment.
The patient was further managed for these conditions and discharged later,
approximately one month after hospitalization, as he was recovering. Treatment was
continued for pneumocystis pneumonia and he was followed up on an outpatient basis.
On study day 127 the outcomes of pneumocystis pneumonia and cholangitis were
resolved; chest x-ray showed no worsening, treatment for pneumocystis was
discontinued.
The investigator additionally reported the adverse event of immune system disorders
(non-serious, grade 3), with same onset and end date and same outcome (recovered/
resolved) as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Further reported information included
the following (verbatim text by the investigator):
IGG were in the 400s (study day 71), CMV-C7HRP 15/50,000 (study day 77), “patient is
easily infected”, “cellular immunosuppressive mechanisms are thought to be at work,

since the disease has changed mainly along the course of pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia “. The patient was treated with Ganciclovir for I.V. infusion on study days 77
– 83.
The investigator assessed the SAEs pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, cholangitis and
the non-serious AE immune system disorders (unk diagnosis) as related to pralsetinib.
MAH Comment: The causal association between the event of pneumonia and
pralsetinib cannot be excluded because of the observed drug-event latency combined
with the absence of any alternative explanations,
AER 3327231 (PT: Neutropenic sepsis): This clinical study case concerns a 58-year-
old male patient (patient number: 1802002) who developed life threatening neutropenic
sepsis whilst enrolled in BO42863, a phase 1/2 study of the highly- selective RET
inhibitor, blu-667, in patients with thyroid cancer, NSCLC and other advanced solid
tumors.
Concurrent conditions included community acquired pneumonia, back pain, gastro-
esophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, erectile dysfunction, constipation, low Vit.
B12, and low iron. Concomitant medications included codeine phosphate, paracetamol,
lansoprazole, levothyroxine, bisoprolol, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, alfacalcidol,
salbutamol, sildenafil, naproxen, pregabalin, senna spp., docusate sodium, ferrous
sulfate and hydroxycobalamine.
After 1660 days of therapy with pralsetinib, the patient was admitted to hospital with type
1 respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,
associated with neutropenic sepsis, septic shock and bacteraemia. He was found to be
hypoxic. His chest X ray showed right sided consolidation, neutrophil count was 0.21 x
10^9/L (range: 1.57- 7 x 10^9/L) and he was diagnosed with life threatening neutropenic
sepsis (grade 4) with a likely chest source. On the same day, he was admitted to
intensive care unit was intubated and antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin was
administered. The next day, the dose of pralsetinib was interrupted in response to the
life threatening neutropenic sepsis and he received treatment with ciprofloxacin,
vancomycin, gentamicin, and norepinephrine. After 22 days of hospitalization, life
threatening neutropenic sepsis was resolved.
The investigator assessed the life threatening neutropenic sepsis as unrelated to
pralsetinib. Additionally, in the investigator’s opinion the neutropenia was related to
sepsis rather than IMP.
MAH Comment: The event resolved on discontinuation of pralsetinib along with
institution of corrective management. In absence of an alternative etiology and given the
known safety profile of pralsetinib, the causative role of pralsetinib in this case of
neutropenic sepsis cannot be excluded.

Category B: Of the total, 36 (36/43; 83.7%) cases reporting 40 infection events were
identified with risk factors/alternative explanations for the infections. A few observations
from the review of these cases are listed below:

The most reported PTs were Sepsis (n=14), Pneumonia (n=6) and Urinary tract
infection (n=2).

Of the 36 cases, 20 concerned males and 16 concerned female patients.

The first dose latencies were < 3 months for 3 AEs, 1 to 3 months for 5 AEs, > 3
months for 1 AE and it was not reported for rest of the 31 AEs.

The additional risk factors included pre-existing white blood cell count decreased,
neutrophils decreased, ureteral catheterization/ stent placement, diabetic state,
smoking, COPD, pre-existing pneumonia, diverticulitis, cellulitis, chronic kidney
disease, cancer progression or metastases to lung and/or use of concomitant
immunosuppressants such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, rituximab,
bendamustine.

Of the 20 infection events for which therapy with pralsetinib was either interrupted or
withdrawn, 16 had resolved/ resolved with sequelae or were resolving while 4 had
not resolved. Positive dechallenge in these was confounded by the fact that the
patients received corrective treatment (IV antibiotics, meropenem,
tazobactam/piperacillin, doxycycline, vancomycin, Rocephin) for 15/16 AEs while
information on corrective treatment was no reported in 1/16 case.

None of the cases reported positive rechallenge.

Evidence of co-existing cytopenia including lymphopenia, neutropenia and
leukopenia was identified in 15/35 cases depicting the immunosuppressed state of
the patient. Among these cases, the reported infections involved mostly respiratory
system and urinary tract. The most common pathogen reported was Staphylococcus
aureus followed by Corona virus and Eshcerichia coli. The opportunistic pathogens
reported included Klebsiella species, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Proteus mirabilis,
Enterobacter species and Aspergillus

The reporter causality was reported as related for 8 AEs, not related for 25 AEs, and
not reported/ unknown for the remaining 6 AEs.
Category C: The remaining 5/43 (11.6%) cases reporting infection events had
insufficient information regarding underlying medical conditions, concurrent diseases,
concomitant medications, event course details, and/or autopsy findings for a
comprehensive analysis. This includes 1 case (AER 2980773) concerning a 13-year-old
female patient who developed pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonia and electrolyte
imbalance 185 days after starting treatment with pralsetinib. Also, 1 case reported the
PT of Pneumocystis pneumoneae which is an opportunistic infection.
Please refer Appendix 5 for the case listings of these cases.
