5 pneumonia with the symptoms including fever and dyspnea.
On admission, physical examination showed crepitation in right
lung and a chest X-ray revealed opacity consistent with right
middle lobe lung infection. The patient was treated with
antibiotics on the same day and pralsetinib was discontinued.
The patient’s hematology test revealed severe leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia and the subsequent blood culture test was
positive for streptococcus pneumoniae. On Study Day 100, the
patient’s laboratory results revealed severe metabolic acidosis
from blood gas analysis, significant anemia, leukopenia, and
thrombocytopenia. The patient also showed elevated
inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation, impaired liver
function, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia,
hypochloremia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Cardiac
stress was indicated by elevated troponin and NT-proBNP levels
and high lactic acid levels were observed. On the same day, the
patient underwent cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated
however, the neurological recovery was poor and the patient
died on the same day. The cardiac arrest was not considered the
primary cause of death, given that the patient’s absolute
neutrophil count had been normal at baseline. It was not
reported if autopsy was performed or not. The physician
assessed causality of fatal pneumonia as not related to
pralsetinib.
The patient was in an immunosuppressive state due to the

underlying progressive malignancy.  This is also confirmed by
the existence of leukopenia and the bacteria, Streptococcus
pneumoneae, which is an opportunistic pathogen. Moreover, the
patient had also received prior radiotherapy and lenvatinib, the
contributory role of which could not be completely ruled out.

This clinical study case concerned a 66-year-old male (patient
number: 2605009) from the USA who developed COVID-19, 764
days after starting therapy with pralsetinib for medullary thyroid
cancer. The patient’s medical history included partial
thyroidectomy. Concurrent conditions included diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, postoperative
hypothyroidism, ankle fracture, medullary thyroid cancer, UTI,
hyperlipidemia, radical dissection neck, thyroidectomy and neck
selective lymph node dissection. Concomitant medications
included atorvastatin, furosemide,
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, potassium chloride, and
levothyroxine. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received study drug
pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg daily and received till Study Day
764. On Study Day 764, the patient developed Grade 3 COVID-
