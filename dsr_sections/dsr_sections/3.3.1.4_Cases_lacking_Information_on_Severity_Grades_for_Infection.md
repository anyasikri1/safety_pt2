Cases lacking Information on Severity Grades for Infection
A total of 249 cases with 272 AEs (including with 4 Grade 5 AEs17) did not report a
severity grading for the AEs related to infection. A summary of these is provided below.
Source and Demographics: Among these 249 cases, majority (172/249) were from Non-
Interventional Study Program, medically unconfirmed (206/249) and included an
indication for lung cancer (198/249). Where reported (n=207), 110 cases concerned
female patients and 97 cases concerned male patients. The age ranged from 34 to 85
years.
Among the AEs, Pneumonia was the most commonly reported PT (145/272), followed by
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (6/272) and Pneumonia fungal (4/272). The first dose
latency ranged from 0 to 1095 days. The action taken with the drug where reported was
dose interrupted for 99 AEs, dose not changed for 75 AEs, drug withdrawn for 29 AEs,
dose reduced for 4 AEs and not applicable for 5 AEs. The event outcome where
reported was resolving/not resolved for 73 AEs and resolved in 49 AEs. The corrective
treatment where reported were symptomatic management, antibiotics, anti-virals, anti-
fungals, steroids and curative procedures.
Among the 249 cases 27 reported co-existing neutropenia/leukopenia/lymphopenia.
Risk Factor Analysis:
Upon review of the 249 cases lacking information on severity grades for infections, none
of the AEs were assessed as having a likely causal association with pralsetinib. Of the
total 249 cases, 26/249 reported risk factors/alternative explanations for the (Category
B) AE while the remaining 223/249 lacked sufficient information on the clinical course,
medical history, concurrent conditions or concomitant medications to medically assess
the case (Category C). These are discussed below.
Category A: None of the cases had a likely association between the drug and the AE.
Category B: Of the total 249 cases, 26 cases (with 31 infection events) reported risk
factors/alternative explanations for the AEs. A few observations from the review of these
cases are listed below:

The most frequently reported PT was Pneumonia (n=10), followed by Pulmonary
tuberculosis (N=2).

The additional risk factors included pre-existing co-morbidities such as diabetes,
lymphopenia, dyslipidemia, pre-existing infections, COPD, underlying cancer
progression and/or metastases to multiple sites, and/or use of immunosuppressant
drugs such as methylprednisolone, prednisolone; dexamethasone, radiotherapy and
invasive medical procedures.
