1.9 g/dL, segmented neutrophils 44%, band forms 4% (ANC:
48/μL), and lactate level of 4.8 mmol/L. The patient's Glasgow
Coma Scale was E3VEM4, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 44.6
mmHg. A diagnosis of septic shock was made based on the
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 13 and
lactate level of 4.8 mmol/L. Despite intensive care measures,
including hemodynamic support, antibiotic therapy, and
continuous venovenous hemofiltration, the patient's condition
deteriorated rapidly. On day 44, the patient experienced
worsening hemodynamics, respiratory failure, and oliguria.
Arterial blood gas analysis showed mixed respiratory and
metabolic acidosis with pH level 7.165. The patient underwent
endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation,
anticonvulsant therapy, and continued hemodynamic support.
After 45 days of initiating therapy with pralsetinib, passed away
in the hospital due to sepsis. An autopsy was not performed. The
Investigator assessed sepsis as related to pralsetinib.
The patient had history of hyperlipidemia and chronic hepatitis B
which could act as contributing factors to infections. Concomitant
use of gemcitabine could also suppress the patient's immunity.
Additionally, the patient had a rupture of brain aneurysm with
intracranial hemorrhage which eventually led to sepsis and
death. Furthermore the co-existing neutropenia also shows the
low immunity in the patient.

while hospitalized in a nursing facility due to lumbar fracture, the
patient experienced a sudden change in vital signs and
developed sepsis. After 1826 days of initiating therapy with
pralsetinib, the patient dies due to sepsis. An autopsy was not
performed.
The occurence of sepsis could be attributed to the lumbar
fracture encountered by the patient in the absence of other
factors.

AER 3502024 (PT: Endocarditis bacterial): This clinical study
case concerns a 76-year-old male patient who developed
Endocarditis bacterial, 363 days after initiating therapy with
pralsetinib for Pancreatic carcinoma metastatic. Patient's
concurrent conditions included carvernous sinus thrombosis,
diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, depression, systemic arterial
hypertension, left anterior fascicular block. Concomitant
medications included dabigatran, levetiracetam, allopurinol,
dapagliflozin propanediol monohydrate, isophane insulin,
bisoprolol, venlafaxine. No medical history and past drugs were
reported. He had no history of alcohol use and tobacco use.
After 363 days of initiating therapy with pralsetinib, the patient
presented to the hospital with malaise, hypotension, and fever,
consistent with sepsis. Blood culture tests revealed growth of
enterococci, and subsequent echocardiogram tests showed a
suspicious image indicative of fatal bacterial endocarditis. The
patient underwent antibiotic treatment guided by blood culture
results but showed no clinical improvement. During
hospitalization, in consultation with the family, non-invasive
support was chosen. No procedures or surgeries were
performed. After 384 days of therapy initiation with pralsetinib,
the patient died due to fatal bacterial endocarditis. It was
unknown if an autopsy was performed or not. The invetigator

laboratory data revealed acute kidney injury, elevated CRP level,
severe lactic acidosis (lactate of 147 mmol/L), neutropenia (WBC
340/μL. The patient received rolikan 40 amp and was intubated
due to dyspnea. Norepinephrine was administered at 20 mL/hr,

antibiotic therapy with meropenem was initiated, and nephrology
was consulted for continuous venovenous hemofiltration in view

and acute kidney injury. Treatment included vasopressors
(norepinephrine, vasopressin, and epinephrine) and broad-
spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, teicoplanin, and
anidulafungin). Despite maximum vasopressor support, blood
pressure remained low (70-80 mmHg). Oxygenation was poor
(PaO2 70.8 mmHg on 100% FiO2, SpO2 70-80%). Sodium
bicarbonate was administered for metabolic acidosis. Chest X-
ray revealed bilateral infiltrates, and lung auscultation revealed
diffuse bilateral crackles. Bedside echocardiography showed
normal cardiac function without effusions. After 252 days of
initiating therapy with pralsetinib, the patient died due to septic
shock. No autopsy was performed. Pralsetinib therapy was
interrupted in response to the septic shock and acute kidney
injury. The investigator assessed both the septic shock and
acute kidney injury as unrelated to pralsetinib.
The use of concomitant steroids, concurrent diabetes and co-
existing neutropenia suggests an immunosuppressive state of
the patient. These factors complicated with acute kidney injury
must have led to septic shock and eventually death.

cell lung cancer. The patient’s medical history, concurrent
conditions, concomitant medications and past drugs were not

developed muscle hemorrhage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, rash
accompanied by herpes virus infection, neutropenia, elevated

back of the knee. After 146 days of starting treatment with
pralsetinib, the patient developed another episode of muscle
hemorrhage, anemia and thrombocytopenia and the patient was
hospitalized. The outcome was not reported for any of the
events. Treatment with pralsetinib was stopped one month
before the patient’s death due to blood count abnormalities. The
patient’s blood count abnormalities showed signs of
improvement, although the patient still had anemia and
thrombocytopenia. Subsequently, the patient developed
peritonitis, ascites, heart failure and non-infectious
gastroenteritis. The patient was hospitalized one day before
death where muscle hemorrhage was diagnosed based on the
diagnostic tests. Eventually, after 146 days of starting treatment
with pralsetinib, the patient died. An autopsy revealed heart
failure as the direct cause of death, with underlying malignant
neoplasm of the upper lobe, bronchus, peritonitis, ascites, and
