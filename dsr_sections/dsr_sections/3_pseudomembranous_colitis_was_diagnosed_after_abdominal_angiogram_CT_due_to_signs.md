3 pseudomembranous colitis was diagnosed after abdominal angiogram CT due to signs
of colitis. On the same day he experienced hypovolemic shock associated with grade 4
thrombocytopenia and grade 4 anemia, reported by the investigator as probably related
to the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. He was diagnosed with
pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile and started on Fidaxomicin.
Pseudomembranous colitis was resolved on Study Day 123. On Study Day 117, the
patient developed Grade 2 pleural effusion, with new respiratory worsening (due to
pleural effusion and pulmonary superinfection), and underwent thoracentesis. Also
concurrent Grade 4 anemia (since Study Day 101). All AEs, except anemia (ongoing),
eventually resolved at latest by Study Day 126. On Study Day 127, pralsetinib was
reintroduced at 400 mg, and the patient was discharged on Study Day 139. On Study
Day 155, the patient developed Grade 5 sepsis and passed away. Autopsy status was
unknown. The investigator assessed the cholangitis, pseudomembranous colitis, sepsis,
pleural effusion as not related to pralsetinib while the investigator reported pulmonary
superinfection as other suspected cause for the pleural effusion.
MAH Comment: The patient presented with a medical history of increased bilirubin and
therefore the concurrent condition of cholangitis could be an ongoing phenomenon from
baseline. While hospitalized the patient received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which

31
Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
is known to cause Clostridium difficile infection including colitis. The patient’s
immunocompromised status as evidenced by the presence of pneumocystis jirovecii,
advanced age and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are potential risk factors for
the progression into sepsis.
AER 3355432 (PT: Pneumonia): This case concerns a 76-year-old female patient
(patient number: 4201002) who developed pyelonephritis, femoral neck fracture, fatal
infectious pneumopathy after receiving treatment with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung
cancer metastatic.
The patient’s medical history included arterial hypertension, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus,
severe osteoporosis, right scapulohumeral periarthritis, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia,
urinary tract infection, insomnia (all ongoing at baseline), pulmonary embolism (past),
idiopathic pneumothorax (past). She was a non-smoker. Concomitant medications
included atorvastatin, pantoprazole, perindopril, levothyroxine, apixaban, lamotrigine,
propranolol, zopiclone.
On Study Day 1, the patient started therapy with oral pralsetinib 400 mg once a day. On
Study Day 17, she developed pyelonephritis (Grade 3), accompanied by hyperthermia
and chills, and was hospitalized. On Study Day 18, treatment with pralsetinib was
interrupted. On the same day, the cyto-bacteriological examination of urine showed
Klebsiella pneumoniae and an abdominal pelvic scan showed an acute bilateral
pyelonephritis picture. She was treated with IV ceftriaxone, IV metronidazole, IV
cefotaxime and oral acide clavulanique/amoxicillin. During hospitalization she also
suffered from anaemia, which was treated by administration of 2 red blood cell units. On
Study Day 24, treatment with pralsetinib was restarted at 400 mg and she was
discharged from hospital on Study Day 28.
On Study Day 30, blood cultures were in progress with no detected organisms, a
negative COVID test, and negative urinary legionella antigen. The pyelonephritis,
hyperthermia, and chills were resolved. However, on the same day, she experienced a
fall (Grade 3), femoral neck fracture (Grade 4), and was also found to have lung
infection/ infectious pneumopathy/ right lower lobar pneumonia (Grade 3). Oxygen
saturations were recorded as 85% on 15 litres of oxygen. Respiratory distress occurred
due to right lower lobar pneumonia. She was given IV furosemide, oxygen therapy and
antibiotics. Hip surgery was not possible due to her respiratory condition. After one week
of antibiotic treatment her condition was still unfavourable. She was put on comfort care
and she passed away on Study Day 39 due to infectious pneumopathy (Grade 5). No
autopsy was performed.
The investigator assessed the causality between pyelonephritis, infectious pneumopathy
and femoral neck fracture as not related to pralsetinib but related to disease under study.

Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
MAH Comment: The patient reported a medical history of urinary tract infection which
could have progressed to pyelonephritis. In addition, the patient was an elderly with
diabetes and dyslipidemia, which is are additional risk factors for the reported events.
AER 3355845 (PT: Lower respiratory tract infection): This case concerns a 33-year-
old female patient (ID: 4701001) who died due to chest infection after receiving
treatment with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer metastatic.
Patient’s medical history included ovarian cyst and anxiety (both ongoing at baseline).
Relevant concurrent adverse events included cough and fatigue (both grade 1).
Concomitant medication included amoxicillin/ clavulanate potassium.
On Study Day 1, the patient started treatment with pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg daily.
On Study Day 51, the patient developed chest infection (Initial: Grade 3 and progressing
to Grade 5) with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, cough, and fever. She
started antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactum, amoxicillin, metronidazole and gentamycin)
but cough became worse and diarrhea ensued. On Study Day 57, pralsetinib was
withdrawn in response to the AE of chest infection and she was admitted to a local
hospital with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Despite the hospital's
best efforts, the patient's condition did not improve, and she passed away on Study Day
60. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed or not. Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance was 1 throughout study. No further information is
available. The investigator assessed the chest infection as related to pralsetinib.
MAH Comment: As the event occurred within 51 days of pralsetinib initiation, a plausible
causality could not be excluded. However, the concurrent worsening fatigue, diarrhea
and vomiting probably due to broad spectrum antibiotics could have contributed to the
fatal outcome. Further information with respect to the status of the ovarian cyst and any
associated treatment was not available.
AER 3428340 (PT: Pneumonia): This case concerns a 57-year-old male patient (patient
number: 3302012) who experienced lung infection and died after receiving treatment
with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer metastatic.
The patient’s medical history included diabetes, developmental venous anomaly in left
occipital lobe, peritumoral edema, anemia and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
increased (all ongoing at baseline). Other adverse events included constipation,
dysgeusia, paraesthesia, alanine aminotransferase increased, blood creatinine
increased (all concurrent) and dysuria (dysuria until study day 58). Concomitant
medications included lactulose, pregabalin, magnesium oxide, sodium chloride,
ursodeoxycholic acid, cefpodoxime proxetil and paracetamol.
On Study Day 1, the patient started therapy with pralsetinib at 400 mg daily. On Study
Day 58, he developed a lung infection accompanied by a sore throat. Seven days’ later

33
Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
fever and cough started. On Study Day 69, he received the most recent pralsetinib dose
prior to death. On the same day (unscheduled visit) he underwent investigations for
pneumonia. Chest CT (non- contrast), respiratory virus test with result negative,
Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR with positive result, atypical pneumonia pathogen multiplex
RT-PCR showed negative, culture (blood, urine, sputum) was negative. Treatment with
paracetamol and cefadroxil was started. Severe general weakness occurred, attributed
by the investigator to the lung infection. On Study Day 71, event become serious and
while receiving treatment at another hospital (ventilator care, inotropic treatment), the
patient died due to lung infection. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed or not.
Therapy was withdrawn in response to the lung infection. Relevant laboratory values:
Absolute neutrophil count 5.26 (screening), 1.90 (Day 22), 3.01 (Day 43), 1.65 (Day 64),
2.20 (Day 69); lymphocyte count was within normal limits.
The physician assessed the lung infection as not related to pralsetinib while related to
Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. No further information was reported.
MAH Comment: The patient’s medical history of diabetes is a risk factor for their
immunocompromised state.
