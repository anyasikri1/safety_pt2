OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
The unblinding of AcceleRET-Lung has presented the first opportunity for the sponsor to
evaluate the comparative safety of the important potential risk of severe infections with
Gavreto against a standard of care treatment option in an equal disease setting. Prior to
the unblinding, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) was providing safety
review of this study. Despite earlier evidence from the ARROW study and a plausible
mechanism of action, based on the evaluation of the comparative safety data from
AcceleRET-Lung study, it could be concluded that a higher frequency and severity of
infections was observed in the pralsetinib-treated cohort compared to the standard of
care cohort. Also, an analysis of neutropenia and lymphopenia in AcceleRET-Lung study
suggested that these events do not appear to account for the higher risk of infection in
pralsetinib treated patients. Similarly, prior systemic corticosteroid use does not appear
to account for severe opportunistic infections in the pralsetinib arm of AcceleRET-Lung.
These findings along with a comprehensive analysis of cumulative evidence from the
Company Safety Database, the study Sponsor and MAH have jointly determined that the
risk classification for severe infections should be updated from an important potential risk
to an important identified risk. In addition, the MAH recommends inclusion of increased
risk of severe infections in the Warnings & Precautions for Gavreto, including in the Core
Data Sheet, local labels, and the Investigator’s Brochure. An Urgent Safety Measure
(USM)-Dear Investigator Letter and Dear Health Care Provider Letter will be issued by
the MAH to inform investigators and prescribers of the identification of this risk on the

basis of this analysis. Study Protocols and the Pralsetinib Investigator’s Brochure will be
updated accordingly.
