3.2.1.4
Analysis of Neutropenia and Lymphopenia Events in Patients
with Grade 3-5 Infections
An analysis of neutropenia/lymphopenia events were also conducted as these conditions
are associated with increased risk of infections in cancer patients, and are already ADRs
for pralsetinib [Gavreto CDS]. For the 28 patients with Grade 3 infections in pralsetinib
treatment arm, a total of six (6/28; 21.4%) patients presented with events of neutropenia
or neutrophil count decreased and lymphopenia or lymphopenia count decreased prior
to the onset of severe infections. Of these, four (4/28; 14.3%) patients presented with
neutrophil count decreased/ neutropenia and three (2/28; 7.1%) patients presented with
lymphocyte count decreased/ lymphopenia (see Table 9). From this analysis,
neutropenia and lymphopenia do not appear to be inciting risk factors for the
development of Grade 3-5 infections in pralsetinib treated patients in AcceleRET-Lung.

Table 10 presents details of these events in six patients with Grade 3 infections. None
of the patients had a medical history of neutropenia or lymphopenia prior to start of
pralsetinib treatment.
From the available data, it was identified that all of the six events were resolved or
resolving prior to onset of Grade 3-5 infections.
