Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
events were considered as not related to pralsetinib treatment by the study investigator
(1 event of pneumonia was attributed to the underlying malignancy).
The remaining two fatal events reporting PT of lower respiratory tract infection and
sepsis were reported in a 33-year-old female and 72-year-old male, respectively. These
two events were reported from Spain and United Kingdom. Both patients had received
pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer metastatic. The time to onset of these events
was reported as 51 and 155 days, respectively. The therapy with pralsetinib was
withdrawn for both the events. The study investigator assessed the event of sepsis as
not related while lower respiratory tract infection as related to pralsetinib treatment.
These five fatal cases were also retrieved in Company Safety database and are
described in detail below:
AER 3172766 (PT: Pneumonia): This clinical study case concerns a 69-year-old female
patient (patient number: 7201001) who presented with bronchopneumonia, 24 days after
starting therapy with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer metastatic.
AEs concurrent to bronchopneumonia included urinary tract infection, mucosal
inflammation, hyponatremia, leukopenia and lymphopenia.
Patient’s medical history included dyspnea, hypertension, insomnia, hyponatremia,
lactate dehydrogenase increased, leukocytosis, hypereosinophilia. She was a non-
smoker. Concomitant medications included formoterol, budesonide-formoterol,
clonazepam, loperamide, ciprofloxacin and saline solution.
On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg daily that was
administered until Study Day 21. On Study Day 22, the pralsetinib dose was interrupted
due to events of Grade 3 hyponatremia in conjunction with Grade 1 leukopenia and
Grade 3 lymphopenia. Laboratory values were reported as lymphocyte count: 1.5 x
10^9/L (screening), 0.28 x 10^9/L (at Day 22), absolute neutrophil count was within
normal limits. On Study Day 25, the patient presented with bronchopneumonia (initial
severity Grade 3), and clinical deterioration with dyspnea, lack of appetite and general
weakness, and was kept under observation in the hospital. She received cefotaxime as
treatment. On Study Day 25, she died due to bronchopneumonia (Grade 5). No
information on autopsy was provided.
The physician assessed the fatal bronchopneumonia as not related to pralsetinib. No
additional information is available at this time.
MAH Comment: The patient developed pneumonia 24 days after pralsetinib treatment
initiation; four days after the last dose of pralsetinib. However, patient’s detailed clinical
course, other investigations like bronchoscopy, sputum analysis, blood cultures and any

imaging studies while she was in the hospital were not reported. Additionally, it was
unknown if an autopsy was performed or not.
AER 3313491 (PT: Sepsis): This clinical study case concerns a 72-year-old male
patient (patient number: 4508003) who developed cholangitis, pseudomembranous
colitis, pleural effusion, episodes of sepsis after receiving treatment with pralsetinib for
non-small cell lung cancer metastatic.
Patient’s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, rib
cage pain (right side), bilirubin increased (all ongoing at baseline) and creatinine
increased (past). Patient was a former smoker. Concomitant medications included
paracetamol, salbutamol, olodaterol, atovaquone, amoxicillin, budesonide, calcium
acetate and carbonate, trimethoprim-sulfamethazole, dexamethasone, diazepam,
enoxaparin, insulin, ipratropium, lorazepam, magnesium, meropenem,
methylprednisolone, metoclopramide, morphine, omeprazole, pantoprazole,
ondansetron, salbutamol, tobramycin, tazobactam, tiotropium, tranexamic acid.
From Study Day 1 to Study Day 62, the patient received treatment with pralsetinib at a
dose of 400 mg QD. On Study Day 63, pralsetinib treatment was interrupted due to
Grade 2 cholangitis. The patient developed Grade 2 cholangitis and hypoxemia, leading
to an ER admission on Study Day 64. Chest Computerized Tomography (CT) on Study
Day 75, showed bilateral infiltrates. Subsequently, on Study Day 78, the patient
developed Grade 4 sepsis of respiratory origin, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
pneumocystis jirovecii positive, and was hospitalized due to worsening of respiratory
condition (received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment). On Study Day 100, Grade
