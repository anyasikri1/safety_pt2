3.3.1.3.1
Single Case Analysis
All the 276 cases reporting Grade 3 infections were medically assessed and assigned to
the causality categories based on the strategy described in Section 2.3.1.
Upon review of the cases reporting Grade 3 infections, none of the cases were
evaluated as Category A, 236 cases reported either risk factors/alternate explanations

for the event (Category B) and for 40 cases there was insufficient information for a
comprehensive causality assessment (Category C).
Category B: Of the total 276 cases, 236 cases (with 267 infection events) reported risk
factors/alternative explanations for the AEs. A few observations from the review of these
cases are listed below:

The most reported PTs were Pneumonia (n=74) followed by Urinary tract infection
(n=35), Sepsis and COVID 19 pneumonia (n=11).

Of the 236 cases, 126 concerned females, 109 concerned males and sex was not
reported the remaining 1 case.

The first dose latencies where reported were < 1 month for 29 AEs, 1 to 3 months
for 46 AEs and > 3 months for 192 AEs.

The additional risk factors included pre-existing co-morbidities such as diabetes,
lymphopenia, dyslipidemia, pre-existing infections, asthma, COPD, underlying
cancer progression and/or metastases to multiple sites, chronic renal insufficiency,
renal stones and/or use of anticancer drugs like cisplatin, pemetrexed, gemcitabine;
use of immunosuppressant drugs such as tocilizumab, methylprednisolone,
prednisolone; dexamethasone, radiotherapy, fluticasone, mesalazine, hormonal
therapy and invasive medical procedures.
Of the 236 cases, evidence of co-existing cytopenia including lymphopenia, neutropenia
and leukopenia was identified in 90% (210/236) of these cases depicting the
immunosuppressed state of the patient

Among these 236 cases, the reported infections mostly involved respiratory system
followed by urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract. In 101 of the 233 cases the
organisms causing the infections were reported. The most common pathogens were
Escherichia coli, Corona virus and Staphylococcus aureus. Some pathogens
causing opportunistic infections were also reported like Pneumocystis jirovecii,
Enterococcus, Varicella zoster, CMV, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoneae
and Aspergillus.

The reporter causality for these Grade 3 events of infections was related for 32 AEs,
not related for 234 AEs while it was not reported for the remaining 1 AE.
Category C: The remaining 40/231 (17.3%) cases reporting Grade 3 infection events
had insufficient information regarding underlying medical conditions, concurrent
diseases, concomitant medications and/or event course details to enable an adequate
causality analysis for the events and pralsetinib.
Please refer Appendix 6 for the case listings of these cases.
