Event Outcome by Action Taken
The event outcome was not reported for 3/47 (6.4%) events, 28/47 (59.6%) were
resolved/resolved with sequelae, 5/47 (10.6%) were resolving, and 11/47 (23.4%) events
did not resolve.
Therapy with pralsetinib was interrupted or withdrawn for 27 AEs and was maintained for
3 AEs while the action taken was not reported for 17 AEs. Of the 27 life-threatening
infections for which pralsetinib was interrupted or withdrawn, 16/27 had
resolved/resolved with sequelae, five (5/27) were resolving while five (5/27) had not
resolved. The outcome of the remaining AEs was not reported.
–
Though the 21/27 AEs which were resolved or resolving on therapy interruption or
withdrawal, a positive dechallenge is confounded by the fact that the patients
received corrective treatments (including but not limited to cefuroxime, gentamicin,
meropenem, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, moxifloxacin, doxycycline).
–
Positive rechallenge was not reported for any of the events.
