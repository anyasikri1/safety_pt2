DISCUSSION
This DSR has been prepared in response to a signal arising from study AcceleRET-Lung
where a patient presented with fatal septic shock with temporal association of onset of
neutropenia, severe bacterial pulmonary infection, following start of pralsetinib therapy,
suggesting plausible causal association with pralsetinib. This DSR provides a
comprehensive assessment of the severe infection AEs in study AcceleRET-Lung and
post marketing sources to evaluate a causal association between pralsetinib treatment
and an increased risk of severe infection and death due to infection.
The CDS version 6.0 (dated September 2023) of pralsetinib specifies infections including
pneumonia, fatal pneumonia and urinary tract infection as an adverse event for the drug.
‘Infections’ as a medical concept is not included in the Warnings and Precautions section
of the CDS. The pralsetinib cRMP (version 5.0) specifies infections as an important
potential risk for the drug. Note however that, these labelling documents of pralsetinib
are based on the earlier evidence from the non-randomized, open label, single arm
ARROW study.
Pralsetinib, given its mode of action, causes reduced bone marrow cellularity, reduced
hemoglobin, reduced reticulocytes, reduced lymphoid cellularity and decreased

61

lymphocyte counts, and hence may be associated with an increased risk of infections.
Decrease in blood cell counts was observed in patients treated with pralsetinib,
especially anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. As cancer patients are already
immunocompromised, neutropenia can put such patients at even greater risk of
developing severe infections. However, in the analysis of severe infections in
AcceleRET-Lung, neither neutropenia nor lymphopenia appear to account for the
increased risk of infection in pralsetinib treated patients. Infections (including Pneumonia
and Urinary Tract Infection) are also listed as an ADR among the other SIC molecule
selpercatinib.
In the pralsetinib preclinical studies, hematological abnormalities (reduced bone marrow
cellularity, attributed to off-target JAK 2 inhibition) and lymphoid effects (reduced
lymphoid cellularity and decreased lymphocyte counts, attributed to stress response)
were observed. Pralsetinib has shown to inhibit JAK 2 pathways as an off-target but with
lower potency compared to RET inhibition or compared to JAK inhibiting compounds
with JAK inhibition as a primary target (Gavreto cRMP). JAK inhibition has the potential
to suppress integral elements of the immune response. The risk of infection, including
opportunistic infections, appears to be increased with all JAK inhibitors (Adas et al.
2022).
For the purpose of this DSR, clinical trial data analysis included review of study results
from ARROW and AcceleRET-Lung study. AcceleRET-Lung presents the first
opportunity to consider randomized safety data comparing pralsetinib with standard of
care treatment options (platinum doublet pembrolizumab) while ARROW, on the other
hand is non-randomized, open-label, study with no comparator arm. The review of the
data from the clinical study AcceleRET-Lung revealed a crude reporting rate 4.6%
(5/108) for patients with fatal infection events and 21.3% (23/108) for patients with Grade
3 and Grade 4 infection events in the pralsetinib treatment arm. On the contrary, no fatal
or Grade 5 infection events were reported and 7.7% (8/104) was reported for Grade 3
and Grade 4 infections in the comparator treatment arm. A significant increase in the
incidence proportion of severe infections (Grades 3-5) was observed in the pralsetinib
treatment arm versus the standard of care arm (two- sided fisher’s exact p=0.0004).
Additional statistical testing using the Aalen-Johansen estimator was performed to
account for the effect of time on treatment, as well as for the occurrences of end of
treatment and/or death that are handled as competing events. In this analysis, a risk
ratio of 3.33, 95% CI: [1.57 ,7.06] was estimated, indicating a higher risk in the
pralsetinib arm (Stegherr R et al. 2021).
In pralsetinib treatment arm of AcceleRET-Lung, five fatal infection AEs (in 5 patients)
were reported, including PTs of pneumonia (n=3), lower respiratory tract infection and
sepsis (n=1 each), with time to onset ranging from 25 to 155 days (median 51 days).
The study investigator assessed all the events except for lower respiratory tract infection
as not related to pralsetinib treatment. On detailed analysis, case (AER 3355432)
reporting pneumonia reported a medical history of urinary tract infection which could

62
Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
have progressed to pyelonephritis (concurrently reported AE). The concurrent femoral
neck fracture with prolonged hospitalization explains the patient’s predisposition to a
likely nosocomial opportunistic infection (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Moreover, the patient
was elderly with diabetes, which is an additional risk factor. Another case (AER
3428340) also reported diabetes as a risk factor along with the immunocompromised
state of the patient. The case (AER 3313491) reporting sepsis presented concurrent
condition of cholangitis and concomitant use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as risk
factors for the AEs in addition to immunocompromised status, elderly age and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. For the remaining 2 cases, there was insufficient
information regarding diagnostic details and/ or clinical course for an adequate medical
assessment.
In pralsetinib treatment arm of AcceleRET-Lung, 32 Grade 3-4 infection events in 23
patients were reported. The reporting investigator assessed 23 AEs as not related while
nine were reported as related to pralsetinib. The time to onset ranged from 20 to 1001
days (with a median of 122 days). In the standard of care arm of the study, no patients
reported fatal infections. The median time to onset of severe infections (Grade 3-4) in
this comparator treatment group was 110.5 days (range: 7 to 528 days). Further, a total
of 7 pralsetinib-treated patients presented with 8 AEs of severe opportunistic infections
of which only 2 patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids prior to the onset of
infection. This analysis suggested that prior corticosteroid use does not appear to be an
inciting risk factor for the development of severe opportunistic infections in these
patients.
The majority of severe infection events in the pralsetinib treated arm (26/32; 81.2%)
were manageable and the patients recovered/ recovered with sequelae/ recovering.
These cases either presented additional risk factors for the events or were limited in
information required for a comprehensive evaluation as the clinical data being used is
not from a formal data cut.
However, note that the evidence from the ARROW study showed an incidence of 3.2%
for patients with fatal infection AEs while 24.4% for patients with Grade 3-4 infection
events in pralsetinib treated patients.
The cumulative search of the Company Safety Database retrieved a total of 806 cases.
Out of these 806 cases, 740 serious cases reporting 794 serious adverse events (AEs)
of infection were evaluated in detail. Of the 794 AEs, 444 were grade 3 or higher (from
387 cases), with pneumonia being the most common. A fatal outcome was reported for
86 events, primarily due to pneumonia (n=25), sepsis (n=19), and COVID-19 (n=18).
Only 2/387 cases (Category A) showed a potential causal association with pralsetinib,
lacking alternative explanations. These involved PTs of Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia (n=1), and neutropenic sepsis (n=1), both resolving after treatment
interruption and with institution of corrective measures. Causative organisms identified in
these 2 cases included Pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV and Streptococcus pneumonia

which projects an opportunistic infection picture owing to the immunocompromised state
of the patients. Additionally, in 1/2 cases there was co-existing neutropenia which could
have further increased the risk of infections. The majority (301/387 cases, Category B)
reported risk factors or additional risk factors for infections, such as pre-existing
comorbidities, cancer progression, and use of other immunosuppressive medications or
medical interventions. The infections mostly involved the respiratory and urinary tract;
and the organisms where reported were mostly corona virus, Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus aureus, herpes zoster, pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV and COVID 19
(SARS COV 2) which could be attributed to the low immunity of these patients.
Cytopenias, including neutropenia, were co-reported in 82/300 cases, potentially
increasing infection risk especially of the sites like lungs and urinary tract. Although more
than half of the events resolved, the assessment of dechallenge information was
confounded by the administration of corrective treatments. The remaining 84 cases
(Category C) lacked sufficient information for causality analysis. An additional 249 cases
with 272 AEs reported no severity grading, were assessed as Categories B (26/249) or
C (223/249).
This review confirms that severe infections, including fatal outcomes, occur in increased
frequency in patients treated with pralsetinib, however, the majority could be attributed to
other factors.
