Of the studies reported in Table 1, BO42864 (AcceleRET-Lung) and BO42863
(ARROW) are included for trial case analysis. Safety data from the AcceleRET-Lung
study triggered this analysis. Additionally, the ARROW study is being included as it
provides a larger dataset of patients and the current labelling documents for Gavreto are
based on the results of this study.
