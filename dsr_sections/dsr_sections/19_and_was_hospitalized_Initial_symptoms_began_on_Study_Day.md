19 and was hospitalized. Initial symptoms began on Study Day
760, progressing to fever, shortness of breath, chills, body
aches, sore throat, headache, and a dry cough. Upon
hospitalization, the patient’s blood pressure was slightly low,
patient had a mild fever and the respiratory rate was elevated.
The dose of pralsetinib was interrupted in response to the
COVID-19 with no improvement observed after the interruption.
On Study Day 765, the patient presented with fever, nausea, and
generalized body pain, along with slightly elevated vital signs
and abnormal lab results, particularly elevated AST and low RBC
and HGB. Pralsetinib was suspended until discharge. Over the
following days until Study Day 771, fibrinogen and procalcitonin
levels were significantly elevated. On Study Day 775, the patient

was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient’s
hemoglobin levels dropped and a blood transfusion was
administered. The results of the CT scans revealed fibrosis,
while blood and respiratory cultures showed no growth. From
Study Day 780 to 782, the patient received methylprednisolone
treatment. However, by Study Day 788, a urine culture indicated
an abnormal growth of Candida glabrata. On Study Day 799, the
patient developed a right pneumothorax, requiring chest tube
placement. On Study Day 809, CT scans of the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis were performed due to persistent leukocytosis and
respiratory failure. The chest CT revealed diffuse interstitial
changes, reticular nodular densities, and a small left pleural
effusion, while abdominal/pelvic scans showed gallstones, a
distended gallbladder, and minor renal abnormalities. Over the
following days, the patient's condition deteriorated, with atrial
fibrillation, elevated WBC counts, and the development of a left
pneumothorax necessitating additional chest tube placement.
Chest X-rays on subsequent days showed bilateral chest tubes
and pneumothoraxes and the patient required increasing oxygen
support. Lab results on Study Day 819 indicated elevated
inflammatory markers. The final chest X-ray revealed severe
bilateral lung infiltration, persistent pneumothoraxes, and
multiple medical devices in place, including endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes, drainage catheters, and chest tubes. On
Study Day 820 to 822, the patient's laboratory results showed
persistently elevated inflammatory markers, including ferritin,
CRP, and D-dimer, along with abnormal liver function and blood
cell counts. On Study Day 822, an X-ray revealed a resolved
right pneumothorax but a small left pneumothorax, with severe
lung scarring and infiltration from interstitial lung disease,
particularly on the right side. The patient required high oxygen
support and positive end-expiratory pressure. Medical records
noted cytopenia in multiple cell lines and active problems
including hyponatremia, leukocytosis, anemia, COVID-19 acute

passed away due to COVID-19. It was not reported if an autopsy
was performed. The physician assessed the COVID-19 as not
related to pralsetinib."


The patient had other risk factors predisposing to COVID 19,
namely, diabetes, dyslipidemia, which eventually aggravated to

Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient received study drug pralsetinib at a
dose of 400 mg (frequency unspecified) and received till Study
Day 56. On Study Day 57, the patient developed Grade 5
urosepsis and was hospitalized with moderate dyspnea and
intermittent fever (39°C). Blood and urine cultures revealed
Escherichia coli infection. A CT chest scan revealed increased
loculated effusion in the left lower hemothorax. Treatment with
levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated. On Study
Day 58, the patient underwent left percutaneous catheter
drainage for increased pleural effusion. On the same day, the
patient received her third cycle of pralsetinib. However,
pralsetinib treatment was discontinued on Study Day 68. On
Study Day 69, the patient died due to fatal urosepsis and
underlying non-small cell lung cancer. An autopsy was not
performed. The investigator assessed the causality of fatal
urosepsis as not related to pralsetinib."


The patient had a an advanced uderlying disease which led to
even superiot venecaval thrombosis along with concurrent
pericardial and pleural effusion.  The patient was also in an
immunosuppressant state as per the presence of Escherichia

residual swallowing issues due to stroke, fatigue and recurrent
aspiration pneumonia prior to pralsetinib treatment.

After 50 days of starting treatment with pralsetinib (400 mg
daily), the patient developed bronchial infection (Grade 5) and
fatigue (Grade 3). Three days later, the patient experienced
stroke (Grade 2) exhibiting symptoms including increased
confusion and inability to use left hand. Two days later, a CT
scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed an almost complete
response to treatment with no evidence of a pneumonia. The
patient was subsequently treated for suspected bronchitis. Blood
tests on the same day showed an elevated white blood cell
count and pralsetinib therapy was temporarily suspended. The
following day, during a scheduled clinic visit, the patient reported
continued inability to use left hand and displayed a left-sided
facial droop. The patient had a productive cough along with loss
of appetite. The patient was prescribed with levofloxacin for the
treatment of infection along with intravenous fluids for
rehydration. After 75 days of receiving the first dose pralsetinib,
the patient died. The cause of death was presumed as bronchial
infection. An autopsy was not performed. The physician
assessed the causality of fatal bronchial infection as possibly
related to pralsetinib."


The concurrent pneumonia/collapse of the lung with history of
recurrent aspiration pneumonia and stroke  must have
contributed to the event of bronchitis.
