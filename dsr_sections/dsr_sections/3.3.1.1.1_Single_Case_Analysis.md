3.3.1.1.1
Single Case Analysis
All the 82 cases reporting fatal infections were medically evaluated and assigned to the
causality categories based on the strategy described in Section 2.3.1.
Upon review none of the cases were assessed as having a likely causal association
between the fatal event and pralsetinib treatment (Category A= 0). Almost half of the
cases were identified as either reporting potential risk factors/ alternate explanations for
the event that led to a fatal outcome (Category B= 42/82; 51.2%) or the other half
reported insufficient information to enable a comprehensive causality assessment
(Category C= 40/82; 48.8%). They are further described below:
Category A: None of the cases had a clear causal association between the drug and
the fatal event in the absence of any alternative risk factors.

Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
Category B: Of the total, 42 cases reporting 43 infection events, reported risk
factors/alternative explanations for the event that led to a fatal outcome. A few
observations from the review of these cases are listed below:

The most frequently reported PTs were Pneumonia (n=15), Sepsis (n=9), COVID 19
(n=5), septic shock (n=3 and Pneumonia aspiration (n=2).

Among the 42 cases, 26 concerned males, 15 concerned females, and sex was not
reported in the remaining 1 case.

The first dose latency was < 1 month for 4 AEs, 1 to 3 months for 13 AEs and >3
months for the rest of the 26 AEs.

The additional risk factors included pre-existing co-morbidities such as diabetes,
lymphopenia, dyslipidemia, pre-existing recurrent urinary tract infections, pre-
existing systemic bacteremia, asthma, COPD, underlying cancer progression and/or
metastases to lung, brain, chronic renal insufficiency and/or use of anticancer drugs
such as cisplatin, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, use of immunosuppressant drugs such
as tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, radiotherapy,
fluticasone, mesalazine.

Of the 42 cases, evidence of co-existing cytopenias including lymphopenia,
neutropenia and leukopenia was identified in 47.6% (20/42) of these cases
depicting the immunosuppressed state of the patient. The most commonly reported
pathogens were Corona virus and Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens known
to cause opportunistic infections were also reported including Pneumocystis
jirovecii, Enterococcus, CMV, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoneae, Candida
albicans, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces.

Therapy with pralsetinib was interrupted/ withdrawn for 25 AEs of infections;
however, the patients later died due to infection. Therapy with pralsetinib was
maintained/not applicable for 1 AE, meanwhile therapy status of pralsetinib was not
reported for the remaining 16 AEs.

Autopsy details were not provided in any of the cases.

The reported causality for these fatal events of infections was reported as related for
