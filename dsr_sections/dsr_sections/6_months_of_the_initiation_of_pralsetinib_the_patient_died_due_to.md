6 months of the initiation of pralsetinib, the patient died due to
sepsis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed or not.




The time to onset of sepsis and abdominal abscess in relation to
pralsetinib therapy is not reported. The medical history of
pancreatic resection surgery explains the development of
abdominal abscess and sepsis as post surgical complications of
major abdominal surgery. Additionally, history of recurrent
urinary tract infection and pre-existing  systemic bacteremia are
possible risk factors.
