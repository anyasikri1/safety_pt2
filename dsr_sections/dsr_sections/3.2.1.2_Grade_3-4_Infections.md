3.2.1.2
Grade 3-4 Infections
A total of 23 (23/108; 21.3%) patients in the pralsetinib treatment arm had a maximum
Grade 3 or Grade 4 infection events (32 total events in these patients) in the AcceleRET-
Lung study (excluding COVID-19 events). Of these 23 patients, 19/23 presented with 28
AEs corresponding to Grade 3 infections while 4/23 patients presented with 4 AEs
corresponding to Grade 4 infections.
On the other hand, 8 (8/104; 7.7%) patients in the comparator treatment arm developed
Grade 3-4 infection events.
An overview of the subjects with Grade 3 and Grade 4 infections in pralsetinib treatment
arm is presented in Appendix 2.
The review of these Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs showed that for 18/32 events, therapy
with pralsetinib was interrupted/ withdrawn/reduced, and was maintained for 13/32
events while action taken with pralsetinib was not applicable for remaining one AE. Of
the 20 AEs for which pralsetinib therapy was modified, 13/18 resolved or resolved with
sequelae while five (5/18) had not resolved. The time to onset was known for all the 32
AEs and ranged from 20 to 1001 days (with a median of 122 days). The reporting
investigator assessed 23 AEs as not related and nine as related to the study drug i.e,
pralsetinib.

Drug Safety Report No: 1132062
Of note, 1811 of these 23 clinical study cases have also been retrieved in the Safety
database and are discussed in detail in Section 3.3.1. However, the remaining 5/23
cases (with patients’ IDs 4307/004, 4517/001, 7301/006, 4208/004 and 4508/002) were
not identified in the Company Safety database and hence a brief overview of these five
cases is provided below:
These five cases reported 7 AEs (including four serious AEs of Urinary Tract infection
[n=1], infection [n=1], Pneumonia [n=2] and three non-serious AEs of Oesophageal
candidiasis, Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Oesophageal infection [n=1 each]).
The cases concerned two male patients and three female patients, with age ranged from
58 to 79 years. The time to onset ranged from 52 to 1001 days (with a median of 280
days). For 6/7 events, pralsetinib dose was not changed while for 1/7 AE, action taken
with pralsetinib was not applicable. All the events were reported as resolved and/or
resolving. Four events were considered as not related while three as related to
pralsetinib treatment by the study investigator.
