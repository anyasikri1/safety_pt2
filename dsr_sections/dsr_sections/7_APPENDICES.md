  Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedDRA version 27.0.  All counts represent
  patients. Multiple occurrences of the same AE in one individual are counted once at the
  highest grade for this patient.
  To the SOC Overall row counts, a patient contributes only with the AE occuring with the
  highest grade within the SOC.
  Percentages are based on N in the column headings.
  Only AEs with onset during the cross-over period are displayed in this output.

  Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedDRA version 27.0.  All counts represent
  patients. Multiple occurrences of the same AE in one individual are counted once at the
  highest grade for this patient.
  To the SOC Overall row counts, a patient contributes only with the AE occuring with the
  highest grade within the SOC.

  Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedDRA version 27.0.  All counts represent
  patients. Multiple occurrences of the same AE in one individual are counted once at the
  highest grade for this patient.
  To the SOC Overall row counts, a patient contributes only with the AE occuring with the
  highest grade within the SOC.
  Percentages are based on N in the column headings.
  AEs with onset during the cross-over period are not displayed in this output.

  Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedDRA version 27.0.  All counts represent
  patients. Multiple occurrences of the same AE in one individual are counted once at the
  highest grade for this patient.
  To the SOC Overall row counts, a patient contributes only with the AE occuring with the
  highest grade within the SOC.
  Percentages are based on N in the column headings.
  AEs with onset during the cross-over period are not displayed in this output.

"AER 2858632 (PT: Pneumonia, Sepsis)

This non-interventional study case concerned a 57-year-old
patient (sex unspecified) from Italy who developed pneumonia
and sepsis while receiving treatment with pralsetinib for non-
small cell lung cancer and lung neoplasm malignant. The
patient’s medical history and past drugs were not reported.
Concurrent conditions included bone metastasis. Concomitant
medications included ramipril, zoledronic acid, cisplatin and
pemetrexed. Maternal family history included myocardial
infarction.

After 29 days of starting treatment with pralsetinib (400 mg
daily), the patient developed hypertension. An unspecified
duration later, the pralsetinib dose was reduced to 300 mg daily.
After 92 days of starting treatment with pralsetinib, the patient
developed pneumonia and fever. The next day, the patient was
hospitalized due to persistent fever and dyspnea. Upon
admission, the patient’s temperature was 37.2°C and oxygen
saturation was critically low at 69%. Initial CT scan confirmed the
diagnosis of pneumonia. A CT scan without contrast detected
extensive parenchymal blob in the lower right lobe and
significant left pleural effusion. The treatment regimen included
oxygen therapy with continuous positive airway pressure,
steroids, ceftriaxone and left pleural drainage. A follow-up CT
scan showed no pulmonary embolism. Blood tests indicated
severe sepsis, likely secondary to pneumonia, with markedly
elevated procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and creatinine levels.
After 92 days of starting treatment with pralsetinib, the patient
died due to pneumonia and sepsis. An autopsy was not
performed. The physician did not report the causality between
fatal pneumonia and fatal sepsis with pralsetinib."

Though the patient developed pneumonia and sepsis while
being treated with pralsetinib, the events could be explained the
immunocompromised state due to the progression of underlying
malignancy and the co-administration of medications like

This non-interventional study case concerned a 70-year-old male
from Turkey who developed COVID-19, 41 days after starting
treatment with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer. The
patient's medical history, concomitant medications or past drugs
were not reported. Concurrent conditions include hypertension,
benign prostatic hyperplasia and bronchial asthma. After 41 days
of starting treatment with pralsetinib, the patient was tested
positive for COVID 19 and was hospitalized due to respiratory
distress associated with COVID-19. After 77 days of starting
treatment with pralsetinib, the patient died due to COVID-19. It
was not reported if an autopsy was performed. The physician
assessed the COVID-19 as not related to pralsetinib."


Though the patient devloped COVID 19 41 days after starting
pralsetinib, the occurence of event could be explained by the

This spontaneous case concerns a 64-year-old female patient
who developed sepsis and abdominal abscess, unspecified
duration after initiating therapy with pralsetinib for thyroid cancer.
Concomitant medications included pantoprazole, however no
