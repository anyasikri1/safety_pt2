0.30 g/L (reference range 4.0-11.0), platelet count of 100 g/L
(reference range 150-400), and the hemoculture for
staphylococcus was positive. According to the investigator’s
assessment, the patient developed septic shock due to scalded
skin syndrome, which was caused by a staphylococcus infection.
Later during the hospitalization, it was observed that the skin
desquamation had affected 40% of the patient's body surface
and the origin of staphylococcal infection was determined to be
the skin. The patient received treatment with intravenous
cefazolin and clindamycin. On Study Day 110, the patient
passed away due to septic shock. No autopsy was performed.
The physician assessed the septic shock and scalded skin
syndrome as related to pralsetinib."


The occurence of the events could be explained by the patient's
immunocompromised state due to the use of prednisolone and
mesalazine. Furthermore the co-existing pancytopenia and the
elderly age of the patient could have contributed to the events as
well.

This clinical study case concerned a 58-year-old male (patient
number: 6305003) from China who developed pneumonia, 263
days after starting therapy with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung
cancer. The patient’s concurrent conditions included right
shoulder pain, cough, fever, lymph node metastases, bone
metastases, and diarrhea. Concomitant medications included
celecoxib, montmorillonite, and ibuprofen. Past drugs included

pemetrexed, and cisplatin. The patient had no history of
neutropenia or pneumonia. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient
received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg daily and
received till Study Day 263. On Study Day 252, the patient's
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was reported as 4.5x109/L. On
Study Day 261, the patient experienced cough and fever and on
Study Day 263, the patient developed Grade 5 pneumonia. The
patient exhibited symptoms including fever (39.4 °C), cough,
production of white sputum, and mild chest distress. A chest CT
scan revealed patchy shadows on bilateral lungs, predominantly
on the right lung. Two pneumonia lesions, local atelectasis of the
right middle lobe and bilateral pleural effusion with limited
thickening of the left pleura was also observed. The patient was
diagnosed with right lung pneumonia on the same day.
Treatment medications for pneumonia included cefradine,
doxofylline, glucose injection, azithromycin, terbutaline
(inhalation) and budesonide. On the same day, the patient died
due to pneumonia. An autopsy was not performed. According to
the investigator’s assessment, there was no evidence for
underlying disease progression and there was no available data
on COVID-19. Therapy with pralsetinib was withdrawn in
response to pneumonia. The physician assessed the fatal
pneumonia as not related to pralsetinib.
The occurence of pneumonia could be explained by the
underlying disease progression as evidenced by the metastasis
to multiple sites. Additionaly, the contributory role of the patient's
past medication with pemetrexed and cisplatin could not be
completely ruled out, even htough the exact dates are not
reported.

initiating therapy with pralsetinib, the patient developed covid-19
pneumonia due to which the patient passed away. It was
unknown if an autopsy was performed or not.


The event of pneumonia developed almost 1.5 years after
initiation of treatment with pralsetinib, which is an unduly long
latency for a causative infection to appear. Secondly, concurrent
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in the setting of covid-19
infection and underlying disease progression are possible risk
factors for the event severity and outcome.
