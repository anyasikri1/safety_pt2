This non-interventional study case concerned a 60-year-old male
from the USA who developed septic shock, 52 days after starting
treatment with pralsetinib for non-small cell lung cancer. The
patient’s medical history was not reported. Concurrent conditions
included hypertension, cerebral ischemia, dyspnea and
pulmonary embolism. Concomitant medications included
prednisone, dihydrocodeine, oxygen and heparin. The patient's
prior cancer treatment regimens included pembrolizumab, RET-
KIF5B and carboplatin+paclitaxel.

Approximately 2.5 months before initiating treatment with
pralsetinib, a CT scan revealed both clinical and pathological
disease progression along with an asymptomatic pulmonary
embolism. After 11 days of starting treatment with pralsetinib, the
patient was hospitalized due to an ischemic attack. After 52 days
of starting treatment with pralsetinib, the patient developed
septic shock (Grade 5). A chest CT scan showed high
inflammatory indices and inflammatory pulmonary thickening.
The patient presented with fever, severe dyspnea and was
treated with empiric antibiotics and high-flow oxygen therapy.

Despite the interventions, the patient's condition progressively
worsened. Eventually, the patient died due to septic shock
accompanied by paraneoplastic infection symptoms including
thrombocytopenia and reduced fibrinogen levels. An autopsy
was not performed. The physician assessed the septic shock as
not related to pralsetinib."


The patient's underlying disease was in a progressive state as
confirmed by the CT scan findings.. This along with the pre-
existing cerebral ishemia, pulmonary embolism and concurrent
paraneoplastic disseminated intravascular coagulationmust have
led to the event of septic shock.

liver segments. Blood cultures detected Klebsiella pneumoniae,
leading to the temporary interruption of pralsetinib. Over the next
few days from Study Day 172 to Study Day 176, the patient's
condition worsened. Elevated C-reactive protein levels were
observed, and additional blood cultures revealed Vancomycin-
Resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Enterococcus faecium. The
patient received various antibiotics, including meropenem,
vancomycin, and linezolid for infection and sepsis. An abdominal
percutaneous catheter drainage was also performed. Eventually,
on Study Day 177, the patient died due to worsening of septic
condition. Autopsy was not performed. The physician assessed
the fatal sepsis as not related to pralsetinib."


The patient had history of cholecystitis and at the time pf
presentation to hospital, there was active arterial bleeding at the
gallbladder bed with possible bile leak along with segmental
ischemia of the liver. This along with the presence of Klebsiella
pneumoneae, vancomycin resistant enterococci and
enterococcus faecium (which depicts the immunosuppressed
state of the patient) must have led to sepsis and death.

1, the patient received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg
daily. On Study Day 87, the patient presented with dyspnea and
fever and was diagnosed with lung infection (Grade 5) which
required hospitalization. Upon hospitalization, vital signs showed
high blood pressure and tachycardia, with a decreased blood
count. The patient exhibited cough, confusion and a high C-
reactive protein (CRP) level. A chest X-ray confirmed pneumonia
in the right lung base. Initial treatment included oxygen therapy
and amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patient also received
alprazolam, docusate sodium, macrogol, morphine, miconazole,
paracetamol, prednisolone, tamsulosin, levetiracetam and
tinzaparin. On Study Day 95, the patient experienced a
recurrence of symptoms, including increased CRP, hepatic
cytolysis, and abdominal pain. A CT scan revealed abscessed
pneumonia in the right lower lobe with possible pulmonary
infarction. Antibiotic therapy was changed to levofloxacin,
resulting in clinical stability but with significant fatigue and
continued oxygen dependence. Physical examination revealed
limited mobility and neurological issues including psychomotor
retardation, disorientation, memory disorders, anxiety, and left
hemiplegia. Cardiopulmonary examination indicated tachycardia
and diminished breath sounds in the right lung field with major
crackles. Abdominal examination showed tenderness and pain,
likely exacerbated by constipation. On Study Day 106, further
testing revealed a positive PCR analysis for pneumocystis in the
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Treatment with tazobactam
and ciprofloxacin was initiated. By Study Day 110, pneumocystis
infection was confirmed, along with severe lymphocytopenia.
Treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was initiated. A
neurological episode occurred on Study Day 115, initially
suspected as encephalitis, but later attributed to either an
epileptic seizure or morphine overdose. An emergency CT scan

consolidations, with ground glass opacities in both upper lungs
and right middle along with and large amount of bilateral pleural
effusion with passive atelectasis. The patient was diagnosed
with first episode of pneumonia (Grade 3) on the same day and
started on intravenous antibiotic. Blood cultures showed the
presence of Staphylococcus aureus. Disease progression was
observed on Study Day 59 through an MRI of the brain. On
Study Day 63, the patient’s vital signs and blood tests were
conducted revealing elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and
abnormal blood cell counts. The pneumonia was treated with
multiple medications including propacetamol, levofloxacin,
tazoperan, and morphine, while ibuprofen was administered for
fever. The patient recovered from first episode of pneumonia
with sequelae and was discharged from the hospital on the same
day with a reduced dosage of pralsetinib at 300 mg. The dose
was interrupted and the last dose of the pralsetinib prior to the

consolidation predominantly in the peri-hilar region. Treatment
with pralsetinib was restarted at a reduced dose of 300 mg due
to renal insufficiency. On Study Day 43, the patient developed
Grade 5 pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, requiring
hospitalization. Laboratory results showed elevated liver
enzymes and CRP levels continued to rise. On Study Day 44, a
bronchial lavage smear revealed cysts of pneumocystis jirovecii

was initiated. On Study Day 211, a CT scan of the chest showed
multiple solid pulmonary nodules indicating metastatic disease,
new mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a small to moderate right
pleural effusion. The patient received treatment with
acetaminophen, cetirizine, enoxaparin, fluticasone, omeprazole,
oxycodone, sodium chloride, potassium phosphate
monobasic/sodium phosphate dibasic/sodium phosphate
monobasic and trazodone to manage symptoms. Over the next
few days, the patient's treatment regimen was adjusted with the
addition of vancomycin, ibuprofen, polyethylene glycol, senna,
lidocaine patch, magnesium sulphate, and potassium chloride. A
chest X-ray on Study Day 216 revealed bilateral pleural effusion
with worsening atelectasis in the lower lobes, increased
consolidation in the right lower lobe due to pneumonia and
persistent consolidation in the middle lobe representing
progressive metastatic disease. On Study Day 234, the patient
died due to progressive disease. An autopsy was not performed.
The physician assessed the causality of pneumonia as not
related to pralsetinib."


The patient had other co-morbidities like thrombosis,
diverticulitis, reflux gastritis and there was underlying disease
progression as well. The concomitant medications like
atezolizumab and fluticasone must have also contributed to this
event

"AER 2800553 (PT: Pneumonia):

This clinical study case concerned a 64-year-old female (patient
number: 6401001) from Hong Kong who developed pneumonia,
64 days after starting therapy with pralsetinib for lung neoplasm
malignant. The patient's medical history included bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. Concurrent conditions included
hemangioma of liver, hepatic cyst, hydrosalpinx and ovarian
cyst. Concomitant medications included codeine, amlodipine,
codeine/pseudoephedrine/triprolidine, aluminum/magnesium
hydroxide and simeticone. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the patient
received study drug pralsetinib at a dose of 400 mg daily and
received till Study Day 64. At the baseline, the patient had

massive right pleural effusion, cough and pleuritic chest wall
pain. A CT scan on Study Day 53 indicated a partial response to
treatment. On Study Day 64, the patient developed Grade 5
pneumonia presenting with generalized weakness, fever (39°C),
malaise, dyspnea and chills. The patient was non-neutropenic on
admission and did not present significant lung finding during the
physical examination. The patient was hospitalized and given
oxygen therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
management. Various tests, including COVID-19, multiplex PCR
for respiratory pathogens, urine culture, and blood culture were
all negative. A chest x-ray revealed a new, dense consolidation
in the right upper lobe. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic
treatment, the patient's chest condition failed to improve, leading
to respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation support.
On Study Day 73, the patient died due pneumonia. The cause of
death was reported as pneumonia and lung cancer. No autopsy
was performed. The investigator assessed pneumonia as related
to pralsetinib."


Though the event of pneumonia had occurred after 2 months of
pralsetinib therapy, the pre-existing massive pleural effusion
must have contributed to it.
