Strategy for Case Analysis
All the cases retrieved by the search strategy outlined above were screened. The focus
of analysis was to identify cases reporting infection events with a Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE severity grade of 3.
All serious cases reporting infection events were individually reviewed to evaluate a
causal association between pralsetinib treatment and an increased risk of severe
infection, and death due to infection. These cases included infection events with severity

grade of 3, as well as cases where information regarding the severity grade was not
reported.
The individual case evaluation of serious cases included a review of the
concurrent/underlying medical conditions and relevant concomitant medications known
to be associated with infections, drug-event latency period, positive de-challenge/re-
challenge, relevant laboratory measures, and/or event outcome.
Based on the medical review and strength of evidence, the cases were categorized as
below:

Category A: Cases with likely causal association with no other alternate
explanation.

Category B: Cases with additional risk factors or plausible alternate
explanation/other etiology for infections.

Category C: Cases with insufficient information to allow a meaningful causality
assessment.
All non-Serious Adverse Events (NSAEs) of infections and AEs of infections with
reported severity of Grade 1 and Grade 2, as retrieved from the Safety database, were
summarized in an aggregate fashion without comprehensive review of the individual
case narratives. For these lower-grade events, no risk factor analysis was conducted.
For cases where severity grading was not reported or was unclear, individual case
narratives were meticulously reviewed to ascertain the severity or seriousness of the
events. An overall aggregate summary has been provided for these cases with no
further risk factor assessment. However, in instances where the narrative review
identified infections of grade 3 or higher severity, a detailed risk factor analysis has been
performed.
