3.1.1
Hematologic and Lymphoid Systems
The key common toxicities noted in rat and/or monkey at systemic exposures similar to
clinical steady state exposures (Area Under Curve [AUC0-24]) at the 400 mg QD dose
included hematological abnormalities (reduced bone marrow cellularity, reduced
hemoglobin, reduced reticulocytes), and lymphoid effects (reduced lymphoid cellularity
and decreased lymphocyte counts). These effects were dose-dependent and reversible.
The primary cellular effects on the bone marrow and erythron parameters were
attributed to off-target Janus kinase (JAK) 2 inhibition. The decreased cellularity of
lymphoid organs corresponding with changes in the hemogram, notably decreased
lymphocytes with increased neutrophils and monocytes was attributed to stress
response rather than to pralsetinib-related off-target effects (Gavreto cRMP).
There are no other relevant toxicology results for this report.
