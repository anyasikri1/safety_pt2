1.2.2.3
Common Types of Infections in Solid Tumor Patients and Their
Management
Infections in cancer patients exhibit diverse characteristics based on their anatomical
location, source, and the duration of cancer treatment. In patients with solid tumors, the
infectious organisms often mirror the individual's resident microflora at the specific
infection site. Some infections in cancer patients follow seasonal patterns like those
observed in the general population, however, other infections are opportunistic.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia poses a significant mortality risk in cancer patients, causing death directly
through respiratory failure and sepsis, and indirectly by interrupting cancer treatments.
Pneumonia has been reported to occur in 50–70% of patients with lung cancer. Cancer-
related alterations in both immune function and lung structure increase the vulnerability
of lung cancer patients to infections. The immune system is compromised not only by
the cancer itself but also by the various treatments employed to combat it.
Simultaneously, cancer can cause structural changes in the lungs, such as airway
obstructions, further exacerbating the risk of infection. This dual impact on immunity and
lung architecture creates a complex environment that significantly enhances the
susceptibility of lung cancer patients to a wide range of infectious complications.
Diagnosis and management are complicated by immune impairments from both cancer
and its treatments, the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms, and atypical clinical
presentations. Cancer patients are susceptible to various types of pneumonia due to
multiple immune defects affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These defects,
along with treatment-induced respiratory tract damage, increase infection risk. Accurate
diagnosis requires careful evaluation of clinical, radiographic, and microbiological data,
considering both community-acquired and nosocomial sources. Given the high risk of
complications, empiric antimicrobial therapy is often initiated promptly when infection is
suspected in these vulnerable patients.
Types of pneumonia
Community-Acquired Pneumonia occurs in patients not recently hospitalized or in long-
term care, with common pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and other Gram-
negative bacteria, as well as atypical pathogens and viruses.
Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia develops 48+ hours after hospital admission and often
involves multidrug-resistant organisms.
Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia occurs in patients with recent healthcare exposure
and has a pathogen spectrum similar to late-onset HAP.

Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia affects patients on mechanical ventilation and is a high
risk for intensive care patients.
Aspiration Pneumonia is caused by inhalation of orogastric or oropharyngeal contents
and often involves anaerobic bacteria.
Post-obstructive Pneumonia occurs due to airway obstruction by solid tumors and is
often polymicrobial. Pneumonia from Septic Emboli is caused by infected intravascular
thrombi.
Pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia
primarily affects patients with CD4 lymphocytopenia. Tuberculosis, can occur in
immunosuppressed cancer patients, often as a reactivation of latent infection.
Nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause chronic, indolent lung infections, with M.
avium-intracellulare complex being a common cause. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is
the most common fungal pneumonia in cancer patients, with risk factors including
prolonged neutropenia and immunosuppressive therapies. Other opportunistic fungi,
including non-Aspergillus molds, are increasingly problematic. Viral pneumonias,
particularly those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and
respiratory viruses, are significant concerns in immunocompromised cancer patients
(Valvani et al. 2019, Evans and Safdar 2011).
Bacterial infections
Gram-positive bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and
Enterococcus species, are responsible for the majority of infections in cancer patients. S.
aureus, including methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant strains, causes a range
of infections treated with vancomycin or beta-lactams, respectively. Streptococcus
species, including viridans group streptococci, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae,
commonly cause bacteremia and pneumonia, with treatments varying from cefepime to
penicillins. Enterococcus infections, often resistant to vancomycin, pose significant
challenges and are treated with daptomycin or linezolid. The prevalence of these
infections in cancer patients, especially those associated with catheter use or
compromised immune systems, emphasizes the need for careful management and
appropriate antibiotic selection based on susceptibility testing and individual patient
factors.
The most common gram-negative organisms include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. E. coli, often causing urinary tract infections
and bacteremia, is typically treated with carbapenems like meropenem or imipenem for
extended spectrum beta lactamase producing strains, while plazomicin is an alternative
for complicated urinary tract infections. Klebsiella species, especially K. pneumoniae,
cause urinary tract and bloodstream infections, with carbapenem-resistant strains
treated using a combination of tigecycline and piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftazidime-

avibactam with a carbapenem. P. aeruginosa infections, though declining due to
prophylactic measures, remain severe and are treated with antipseudomonal beta-
lactams such as piperacillin-tazobactam (Delgado and Guddati 2021, Seo et al. 2021).
Fungal infections
Fungal infections pose a significant threat to cancer patients, especially those with
prolonged neutropenia. Candida species, primarily Candida albicans, cause invasive
yeast infections, typically treated with fluconazole. However, fluconazole prophylaxis has
led to an increase in Aspergillus infections, particularly Aspergillus fumigatus, which
commonly causes pneumonia. Aspergillus is treated with azoles and echinocandins like
caspofungin. Less common fungal pathogens include Fusarium and Scedosporium
species (Delgado and Guddati 2021, Seo et al. 2021).
Viral infections
Viral infections are a significant concern for cancer patients, particularly those
undergoing chemotherapy or transplantation. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, VZV,
and community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) are the most common threats.
HSV reactivations, frequent in chemotherapy patients, are treated with acyclovir. VZV
reactivation causes herpes zoster, often months after treatment initiation, and may
require prophylactic acyclovir. CARVs, including influenza, parainfluenza, and
coronaviruses, pose a higher risk to neutropenic patients. The novel Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has shown potentially more severe outcomes in
cancer patients and has significantly impacted cancer management practices (Delgado
and Guddati 2021, Seo et al. 2021).
