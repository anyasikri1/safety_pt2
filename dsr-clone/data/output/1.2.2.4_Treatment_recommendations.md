1.2.2.4
Treatment recommendations
Treatment recommendations for cancer patients at risk of infections focus on
antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. For antibacterial prophylaxis,
fluoroquinolones are recommended for high-risk patients (neutrophil count 100
cells/mm3 for 7 days), with levofloxacin preferred for those at risk of Streptococcus
viridans mucositis. Intermediate-risk patients require case-by-case evaluation, while low-
risk patients generally don't need routine prophylaxis. Antifungal prophylaxis is
recommended for patients with anticipated severe neutropenia lasting over 7 days, with
fluconazole for those likely to develop mucositis and posaconazole or voriconazole for
those at risk of invasive mold infections. Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is advised for high-risk patients. Antiviral prophylaxis
includes annual influenza vaccination, acyclovir or valacyclovir for HSV-seropositive
patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation or acute leukemia
induction, and entecavir or tenofovir for those at risk of hepatitis B reactivation (Delgado
and Guddati 2021, Seo et al. 2021).
