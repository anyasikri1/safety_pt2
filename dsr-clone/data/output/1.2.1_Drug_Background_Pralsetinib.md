1.2.1
Drug Background – Pralsetinib
Pralsetinib is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of oncogenic rearranged during
transfection (RET) fusion and mutant proteins. RET fusions are oncogenic drivers in 1-
2% of NSCLC, 10-20% of papillary thyroid cancer and, at lower prevalence, below 1%
across multiple other solid tumor types. Pralsetinib inhibits the ligand independent
constitutive activation of the RET tyrosine kinase activity and therefore prevents
downstream oncogenic cell signaling.
Pralsetinib was first granted marketing approval in the U.S. on 4 September 2020, which
marks the IBD. As of the Data Lock Point (DLP) of the latest Periodic Benefit Risk
Evaluation Report (PBRER) (3 March 2024), pralsetinib has been approved in 61
countries worldwide. As of September 2024, Pralsetinib has been deregistered in the
majority of countries where it was initially authorized, after the decision was taken to
discontinue global marketing and development of the program, except in the United
States and Greater China. This action was not taken due to any efficacy or safety
findings in patients treated with pralsetinib. As of the time of authoring of this report, the
global safety database and Market Authorization Holder (MAH)5 status in the EU and US
have been transferred from Roche to Blueprint Medicines. Pralsetinib is available as
hard capsules and the recommended dose is 400 mg once daily (Gavreto PBRER).
