1.2.2
Background on Severe Infection
Infectious diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens or their toxins, spread from
infected people, animals, or contaminated objects to susceptible individuals.
Opportunistic infections arise when typically, harmless microorganisms including
bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites become pathogenic in individuals with weakened
immune systems. These infections exploit compromised host defenses, particularly in
cases of immunodeficiency disorders, to cause disease where they normally would not
(Van Seventer and Hochberg, 2017). Severe infections are defined as all preferred
terms (PTs) from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system
organ class (SOC) “Infections and infestations”, when of severity Grade ≥3.
