RET fusions as a result of chromosomal rearrangement have been found in tumors 
NSCLC, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), colon, breast, pancreatic, ovary, salivary 
carcinomas, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and suggest that RET fusions 
may be oncogenic in many tumor types (Santoro et al. 1992; ATA Guidelines Taskforce 
et al. 2009; Ballerini et al. 2012; Kohno et al. 2012; Lipson et al. 2012; Medico et al. 
2015; Stransky et al. 2014; Takeuchi et al. 2012; Antonescu et al. 2015; 
Wang et al. 2016; Kang et al. 2017).  
2.3 
SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
Pralsetinib (RO7499790; trade name GAVRETO; formerly referred to as BLU-667, 
BLU123244, or X581238) is a potent and selective inhibitor of RET kinase and 
oncogenic RET mutants.  Pralsetinib was designed as a highly potent and selective 
inhibitor of oncogenic RET fusion and mutant proteins.  RET fusions are oncogenic 
drivers in 12% of NSCLC, 1020% of PTC and at lower prevalence, below 1% across 
multiple other tumor types.  RET mutations have been shown to be oncogenic in MTC 
with a prevalence of up to 60% in the sporadic and above 90% in the hereditary form of 
MTC.  Pralsetinib inhibits the ligand independent constitutive activation of the RET 
tyrosine kinase activity and therefore prevents downstream oncogenic cell signalling.  
Pralsetinib demonstrates robust antitumor activity in several RET-driven in vitro and 
in vivo mouse models, and tolerability at pharmacologically active doses in nonclinical 
toxicology studies in rats and monkeys.  Together, these data provide strong rationale 
for exploring the clinical utility of pralsetinib in advanced cancer patients with RET 
alterations (RET fusions, activating mutations, and some resistance mutations).  Overall, 
the available nonclinical data demonstrate an acceptable benefit-risk profile for the 
clinical testing of pralsetinib. 
2.4 
OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 
Studies in the clinical development program of pralsetinib include:  
 
Five completed clinical studies/cohorts evaluating safety, efficacy, and PK of 
pralsetinib in adult patients with solid tumors with RET alterations including gene 
fusions:BO41932 (cohort K), ML41591 (RET cohort), ML42439, BO42863 and 
BO42864 (LPLV: 27 January 2025; CSR under preparation).  
 
Three ongoing clinical pharmacology studies: 
o Patients with RET-altered solid tumors (JO43175 and JO43701)  
o Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (GP43164) 
 
Seven dedicated clinical pharmacology studies (completed) to determine the 
absorption, metabolism, disposition, and PK of pralsetinib in humans, and to explore 
the effects of extrinsic factors (food, drug-drug interactions [DDIs]) on PK 
parameters, to compare the relative bioavailability of different pralsetinib 
formulations, or to assess the impact of hepatic impairment on pralsetinib PK 
(BP42858, BP42859, BP42860, BP42861, BP42862, GP43162, and GP43163).  All

1. 
SUMMARY 
1.1 
SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
Rearranged during transfection (RET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in several 
neural, neuroendocrine, and genitourinary tissue types that normally requires ligand and 
co-receptor binding for activation (Mulligan 2014).  Aberrant activation of RET is a critical 
driver of tumor growth and proliferation across a broad number of solid tumors 
(Mulligan 2014).   
As the prevalence of tumor genomic sequencing has increased, the importance of RET 
alterations in human cancers provides a strong rationale for the development of 
therapeutics targeting RET.  
Pralsetinib (previously known as BLU-667) is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of RET 
fusion proteins and oncogenic RET mutant.  Since July 2020, pralsetinib was being co-
developed as an anticancer therapeutic by Genentech/Roche (hereafter referred to as 
“Roche”) in collaboration with Blueprint Medicines Corporation (hereafter referred to as 
“Blueprint Medicines”), as well as CStone Pharmaceuticals (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. in Greater 
China and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in Japan (hereafter referred to as “Chugai”).  
Effective February 22, 2024, all rights to pralsetinib previously granted to Roche and 
Chugai were returned to Blueprint Medicines and the collaboration between parties has 
been terminated.

5.5.5 
Pre-approval Access Program and Individual INDs 
A total of 393 patients who have RET fusion-positive or RET-altered cancers and are 
either ineligible or are otherwise unable to access an ongoing pralsetinib clinical trial 
have been treated with pralsetinib as part of a PAAP and individual INDs under the CUP, 
of whom 2 patients received pralsetinib in combination with osimertinib and 1 patient 
received pralsetinib in combination with gefitinib as of 18 December 2021. 
5.6 
MARKETING EXPERIENCE 
GAVRETO (pralsetinib) was first granted marketing approval in the U.S. on 4 September 
2020, which marks its international birth date (IBD).  GAVRETO was then further 
approved in over 60 countries worldwide, most of which are now discontinuing the 
commercialization of the product for commercial reasons.  Since the marketing 
authorization, overall reported AEs have been consistent with the known safety profile of 
pralsetinib; no new risks have been identified in the post-marketing setting.  
Since the IBD (4 September 2020), an estimated cumulative total of 2,322 patients have 
received GAVRETO from marketing experience.

4.3.3 
Repeat-Dose Toxicity 
Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies up to 13-weeks in duration were conducted in rats and 
monkeys and included an assessment of recovery from pralsetinib-related effects in the 
28-day studies (Table 4).  Pralsetinib was administered QD by oral gavage in all studies.   
The main toxicities of pralsetinib observed in rat and/or monkeys included hematological 
abnormalities, effects on bony tissues, reproductive/developmental toxicities, metabolic 
perturbation, and effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, as discussed 
below.  With the exception of embryofetal toxicities discussed in Section 4.3.6, which 
were attributed to on-target RET inhibition, the majority of the pralsetinib-related 
toxicologic effects were attributed to off-target kinase inhibition (i.e., JAK2, VEGFR, and 
FGFR).  The severely toxic effects in the rat were primarily the result of inanition, 
hematologic abnormalities, vascular perturbations, and metabolic alterations.  The 
severely toxic effect in monkeys was attributed to bacterial sepsis secondary to 
VEGFR‑inhibition mediated gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction (erosion/ulceration).  
4.3.3.1 
Effects on Hematologic and Lymphoid Systems  
Hematological abnormalities (reduced bone marrow cellularity, reduced hemoglobin, 
reduced reticulocytes), and lymphoid effects (reduced lymphoid cellularity and 
decreased lymphocyte counts) were noted in rat and/or monkey at doses  5 mg/kg.  
Reduced bone marrow cellularity was considered adverse in rat at doses  20 mg/kg.  
These effects were dose-dependent and reversible.  The primary cellular effects on the 
bone marrow and erythron parameters were attributed to off-target JAK2 inhibition due 
to the reliance upon JAK2 for erythropoietin signaling (Parganas et al. 1998; 
Broxmeyer 2013; Springuel et al. 2015).  The decreased cellularity of lymphoid organs 
corresponding with changes in the leukon, notably decreased lymphocytes with 
increased neutrophils and monocytes, was attributed to stress response rather than to 
pralsetinib-related off-target effects (Everds et al. 2013). 
4.3.3.2 
Effects on Bone  
Effects on bone (physeal dysplasia) in both rats and monkeys and incisor tooth 
degeneration in rats were observed at doses  10 mg/kg in rat and at 15/7.5 mg/kg in 
monkeys (28-day study only).  Physeal dysplasia is a lesion often encountered 
secondary to impairment of VEGF-dependent angiogenesis, while incisor degeneration 
has been previously described after VEGF and FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition 
(Patyna et al. 2008; Chen and Cleck 2009; Fletcher et al. 2010).  In general, the physes 
of humans close at puberty and thus are not susceptible to drug-related physeal 
dysorganization observed in rodents, which have a persistent open physis (Frazier 2017; 
Hall et al. 2016). Similarly, the incisor teeth in rodents grow continuously making the 
translatability of incisor degeneration to humans unclear.   
4.3.3.3 
Metabolic Effects 
Elevation of circulating phosphorus concentration with corresponding mineralization in 
soft tissues was present in the rat.  The mineralization was minimal and non-adverse at
